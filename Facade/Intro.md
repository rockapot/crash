*I step off the escalator and the rain rattles the glass dome of Tycho station, slapping against it like leathery sheets from the black sky. It’s much worse than I remember. They’ve turned it up to savage levels. It’s a goddamn monsoon, a waste of air, a waste of water, and all I can think is that this isn’t the place we grew up.*
*To the man in front of me I ask: “Where is the funeral home?” But he grunts an answer, huffs away and disappears into the crowd. His suitcase draws twin tracks of wetness on the concrete and mixes with the other tracks and footprints to form a Byzantine web barely visible under the onslaught of travelers. Heels clack, voices murmur, the announcements run nonstop. A thin layer of steam rises.*
*The people in the crowd I recognize even less. They wear layered coats and suits, gray but for the tinge of color: a lapel here, a rose there. Hypercolor shoes. As we pour out of the station’s dome they raise their transparent umbrellas and the lightshow above us blazes. Bright! Shapes and letters caught in midair, blinking, twisting, trails of marching ants circling them like cartouches. Girls and whisky and faraway sunsets. My umbrella is much more humble, it rises to blot out the signs.*
*I pinball among the crowd between pretty faces and perfect haircuts and ask my question. I am rebuffed each time. Only one man stops to tell me he doesn’t know, then steps into the street, raising his newspaper above his head, and ducks into a taxi.*
*Among the crowd I spot one like no other. A shorter, older woman, her face round and plain and unhurried. She stands under an awning by a butcher’s window and I join her and ask, “Madam, do you know this city?”*
*She studies me, sees my tattered service coat, my worn-out shoes. My pack slung behind me overflowing with bulging shapes a foot above my head. My homely umbrella. “You lost, child?”*
*“I’m looking for the funeral home.”*
*“Which one?”*
*“How do you mean?”*
*“Which funeral home? In what district?”*
*“We didn’t have districts when I grew up.”*
*“Lord Almighty you’ve been gone. Not your city anymore, is it? Swept away is Tycho past!”*
*“Help me find my way, then.”*
*“A lot’s changed,” she says, eyeing the train tubes that pass above us in a spiderweb of crooked geometry. Air hisses the sound of tired pneumatics. The whole line shudders, and metal bends and groans unseen around us. Something crunches into the garbage bags down the block. “Huh,” she says. “Be wary you don’t carry that old city with you in the new. Good way to get devoured.”*
*People pass around us, mixing with the molar-shaped taxis that trundle down the street. The crowd forms another state of matter, neither solid, nor liquid. A system of bidirectional particles. How could so many people be here by choice? I pull out my soggy ticket where I wrote down the address and I show it to the woman.*
*“The Arms!” She is taken aback at the note. “Don’t go ye there. Less you wanted to see life at its worst.”*
*She sends me to the train line I seek without further admonishment and melds into the passersby. I lift my umbrella to eye the world above the neon and moving screens. Barely visible in the halo of Tycho’s night the Earth hovers dull and grey and waning.*
---- 
On 19 March 539, Yuki died of heart failure in her studio unit in the Asylum Arms, South Tycho. She was twenty-nine. At the time of her death she weighed ninety pounds. Paramedics descended on her balcony, dropping from lines anchored to hovering ambulances, their spotlights overpowering the haze of blue and pink signs. Neighbors would describe it akin to a commando raid, a drug bust. 
But she was no dealer, no junkie. They found her hooked up to a tunneling unit, a piece of headgear that projected her consciousness instantaneously to a remote android unit elsewhere in the solar system. This way she commuted to Saturn’s moon Titan, where she worked for the last two years as a nurse’s assistant in a frontier hospital.
When they found her she’d been hooked up for four days straight, her body lying unmoving on her bed, her consciousness in deep space. The stench was horrible. In preparation for her final journey she had inserted an intravenous drip in her arm and donned an adult diaper before going under. When they found her the line had torn loose and the mattress was soaked with urine. They tell me the super had to replace the whole carpet. It was like a swamp. Even the walls were rank and had started to mold over.
Her headgear was an unlicensed unit bought off a junk dealer. Couldn’t be traced. Not even the endpoints of her journey came to light in the investigation. And she’d been at it for quite some time. She was emaciated. Nothing more than a bag of bones and organs. Epidermis stretched paper-thin over cheekbones sharp as hooks, sores in her scalp and forehead from her tunneling equipment. She had been going in for days at a time, mind and body divorced as the latter wasted to nothing. Wherever she was going, it wasn’t her job on Titan. She’d quit almost two months prior to her death. The pathologist’s report agreed that two months of being largely immobile seemed right given her state. Something about the compression of her spine and the effects of augmented Lunar gravity. The conclusion was appalling: She remained connected, tunneled in, for dangerously long stretches, neglected to eat, to drink, to bathe. And kept it up for some time. She had become obsessed, highly unstable.
There was no police investigation. The noble detective to whom I was referred left a voice message punctuated by chomps of a presumably ample meal. He stated that seven months ago Yuki visited a sublimation clinic in Tycho by the Outer Bend and applied for assisted suicide. She was advised to undergo sterilization instead, as she was young, healthy, had a job and residence. I don’t know why she would apply for such a thing. She wasn’t a nut about religion or overpopulation. But the visit was on record and she was dead by her own hand. Suicide, the detective said. Possibly a psychotic break. Anything else had nothing to do with the Tycho PD. *Have a nice day and sorry for your loss.*
They charged the carpet to her savings account and sent the rest to probate. She was cremated according to her wishes, but the political climate made it impossible to inter her ashes with the rest of her family on Mars. So she spent her first few weeks of eternity here on Luna, in Tycho, just a few miles from where we went to school.
---- 
I didn’t know what I had to prove anymore. That I could make it, that I could escape. Had to show up my old man just one more time. The one kid you threw away was the only one who climbed out the hole you dug for us. I spent my early twenties busting my ass to get an engineering degree and a commercial flight rating and took the first offworld assignment I could get at twenty-five. Anything to get out of Tycho, out of Luna, into the rest of the human empire. The rush of variable gravity, the shift of pitch and yaw and roll. The spinning of the stars, the gambol of the spacecraft and the unbounded freedom of three dimensions. All the thrust vectors and quaternions and Feynman diagrams came to life. I got a job as an astronavigator with a deep salvage firm run out of Lavinia Planitia on Venus. There was a goldmine of ancient space junk if you could find it. Wreckage from the great interstellar seedships that came to horrible ends centuries ago still drifted in eccentric orbits around Sol. Billions in rare minerals and lost technology. My eyes were to the stars.
My launch window to Venus came in June of 534. Ever since I’d been at the Salt Flats of Lavinia. A full terraform was still centuries away. But a myriad of honeycombed solar panels in orbit around Venus redirected enough solar energy to cool the daytime surface so that its temperature hovered just below the boiling point of water. Approaching those solar panels was like zooming in to the multifaceted eye of some eldritch insect. A godlike harmony of hexagons and superstructures and tensor fields keeping it all in place. I thought I’d come home.
By January of 539 the hauls were slim. I was working for an outfit called Undine that specialized in recovery from the Lagrange points of the inner circle. I’d been en route to the Venusian L5 point for about two months on the Dotty, a rusty frigate with a crew of five. At a rare comm window I picked up a message from Yuki. Text-only. She’d sent it weeks ago. I was paging through my comms on the astro deck when I saw it.
*How’s the weather up there?*
I sat to attention. My feet came off the console and onto the deck. I felt like someone had entered the room, but I was alone in the cabin with the solar shields pulled. The sun’s orange rays seeping through the cracks of the shield edges to form searing rounded rectangles of fake dusk. We’d just completed a plane change and wouldn’t require course corrections for another few days, but our charter required a licensed pilot on the flight deck at all times.
*Falling stars and comet tails,* I replied.
I thought of Yuki as the last time I saw her, then of my friends, the unending stream of weddings and babies on Luna. I attended none of them. My own empty flat on Venus baking in the sulphuric daylight. The rumbling engines echoed down the catwalks of the Dotty. Below me, her empty bays waited for the haul. Rows of EV suits lined the airlock in a space-age catacomb. 
Yuki’s reply came several minutes later.
*The days are getting longer. Want some company?*
*You looking to leave Luna?* I replied quickly.
And several minutes after that.
*In a manner of speaking. Let’s catch up. Go to a shop and get a doll would ya. I want to talk to you face to face.*
*No dolls here. No nothing. I’m aboard ship eight weeks out another twenty back. Just tell me what’s on your mind.*
I didn’t have the heart to tell her that we did have a doll aboard, a service android. The whole notion of this artificial being having Yuki’s consciousness infused in its bioprinted brain was too unsettling. That I should treat this thing as if it were her. This mannequin, this unworthy receptacle for her soul. Maybe on the gasworlds they went for things like that, but here in the inner circle it was too bizarre. That was the last time Yuki tried to reach out to me, during a time I calculate would be the height of her strange addiction. 
Before she replied, Gunthrie came up the rickety service ladder to relieve me. He slid into his polished vinyl chair frayed at the corners. Pulled on his headset and blasted his shrill music.
I have the ball, he said, grabbing the flight handle from his console.
What are you doing? I answered. Leave it on autopilot.
I need my hours, man. I’m up for recertification.
You’ll just waste fuel. Save some for the haul.
Are you for real? He pulled his headset off and gestured. There’s nothing left out there. The Core Consortium picked it clean years ago. I’m just here to get my hours and go home.
Home?
Gunthrie stabbed at the buttons on his console. Half of them were stuck or missing labels.
There’s a supply ship, he said. The Marie Curie. Waiting at L5. Straight shot to Luna in forty-five days.
You can’t just leave in the middle of a job!
Ah, he interrupted with a raised index finger. It’s only a job if we get paid. And we’ve already been screwed out of two commissions on technicalities.
So it doesn’t bother you to leave us shorthanded?
Shorthanded? So you take one less eight-hour nap. Don’t deny it, I’ve seen you. There’s no shame in it. Johansson spends his time on shift jerking off in the head.
You are a piece of work, Gunthrie.
Why don’t you come with us? You’re from Luna.
You do this, you’ll never work out of Lavinia again.
Don’t plan to.
I left, shaking my head, went down to get a coffee from the lounge and relax. I wound up eating half a vacuum packed meal and forgetting about my conversation with Yuki.
I didn’t pick up her replies until our next window another two months out, when we were almost at L5. Things were going as Gunthrie had predicted: No salvage on our scopes. The vast pointlessness of space ringing heavy in our ears. We were coming out of a turbulent correction as I was eating in the lounge when her messages all came through, one after the other.
*I wish I could tell you.*
*Or show you.*
*Life as we know it exists out of these lines.*
And finally:
*I have been to Jupiter and seen the Great Dying God.*
Along with these messages was another from the Lunar consulate at Lavinia, writing to inform me of her passing.
---- 
I enter the funeral home, a tiny affair with a lobby of overly ornate furniture. Victorian, the ceiling is Rococo. Plush oval upholstery. My sister is standing there, she’s just arrived too. She’s in a hooded trench coat and face mask. She turns and pulls off the mask and gives a pained smile and puts her arms around my neck. It takes me a moment to realize her intentions and I return the embrace. After all, we’re family.
I could have met you at the station.
No pregnant sister of mine needs to pick me up. I can do just fine.
I wasn’t sure you’d come.
I said I would.
I thought it was just one of those things you say. It’s good to see you, ge.
How’s Rusty.
Fine. With his folks. I asked him to give us some space.
You didn’t have to do that. I can stay with Tyler. You shouldn’t put yourself out for me.
Who else but you? She pulls away and turns around quickly, too quickly, maybe to hide her tears.
