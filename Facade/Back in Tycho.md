I enter the funeral home, a tiny affair with a lobby of ornate Victorian furniture. The ceiling is Rococo. Plush oval upholstery. My sister is standing there, she’s just arrived too. She’s in a hooded trench coat and face mask. She turns and pulls off the mask and gives a pained smile and puts her arms around my neck. It takes me a moment to realize her intentions and I return the embrace. After all, we’re family.
I could have met you at the station.
No pregnant sister of mine needs to pick me up. I can do just fine.
I wasn’t sure you’d come.
I said I would.
I thought it was just one of those things you say. It’s good to see you, ge.
How’s Rusty.
Fine. With his folks. I asked him to give us some space.
You didn’t have to do that. I can stay with Tyler. You shouldn’t put yourself out for me.
Who else but you? She pulls away and turns around quickly, too quickly, maybe to hide her tears.
