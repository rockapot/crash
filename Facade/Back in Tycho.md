---- 
My sister stands before me an apparition, a beaked and goggled mask on her face, under a black woolen cloche black trench coat and vinyl boots. She’s under a domed yellow awning that matches the curvature of her hat. The awning is prickly with raindrops, as are the streets around her. Water hits them hard enough to spike on the ground all jagged, hard enough to reduce the opacity of the buildings along the street, their windows floating in the static. Even though it’s been five years and I can’t see her face, it’s her. The way she clutches her hands and rubs her thumbs together like she’s trying to start a fire. Shades and spirits rise against the rain all around her.
I walk against a current of water and crowd and shout a greeting but there’s too much traffic and noise to hear each other. It smells like melted rubber and ozone in the streets. Bad wiring. She doesn’t even nod to acknowledge me and those cool circular eyeholes catch the lantern for an instant as she leads us down concrete steps set in the sidewalk. She steps quickly despite her heels, trailing one hand on the metal guardrail. I fold my umbrella. My bag creates waves of gravity within me. It’s hard to dip, to lean forward, so I catch myself on both rails using both hands and drag myself down into the stone and concrete.
We enter the funeral home, a tiny affair with a lobby of ornate Victorian furniture. The ceiling is Rococo. Water is still draining down from the channels on my umbrella onto the padded carpet. No one notices. My sister turns and pulls off the mask and gives a pained smile. The years have left their stain under her eyes, but they are still there, still bright. She approaches and it takes me a moment to realize her intentions and I return her embrace.
I could have met you at the station.
No pregnant sister of mine needs to take care of me. I can do just fine.
I wasn’t sure you’d come.
I said I would.
I thought it was just one of those things you say. It’s good to see you, ge.
How’s Rusty.
Fine. With his folks. I asked him to give us some space.
You didn’t have to do that. I can stay with Tyler. You shouldn’t put yourself out for me.
Who else but family?
When are you due?
She pulls away and turns around quickly, too quickly, like she’s hiding something.
Is everything okay?
Yeah.
She turns around, biting her lip. She can’t bring herself to look me in the eye.
Yi, what’s wrong?
The lights flicker in the prelude to a brownout. A couple with a young boy shuffle out past us and open the door to the roaring rain. We sit in the parlor next to the tidy reception.
I don’t know if I should tell you this, she says.
You can tell me anything.
We stare at a cardboard box on a wood side table, about a foot long on each side. It seems to cut into the existence of the room. There’s a tiny sticker with a barcode near the top edge. 
Were you close? I ask. Did you two talk much?
Not really. Happy birthday. Merry Christmas. I hardly spoke to her at all. You?
Same. Why don’t you tell me what’s eating you?
In time. You must be hungry. Grab that box and let’s go.
Along the way we pass two helmeted policemen kneeling by a transparent tarp on the ground. Yellow tape and chemical lanterns delimit a small section of the road. A stray hand lies pale against the asphalt. Nobody stops to look.
