## Interlude (Midia)
I had a mother, you know. And a father. But I didn’t look like them. I didn’t look like anyone else in town. There are only so many faces in the world, don’t you think? In Midia you could tell someone’s blood three generations back by the crook of their nose or the size of their ears. My parents were both outlanders and so I thought it was natural that we didn’t look like the Ilyu or the Hamda or any other clan in town. When I was young I wondered why I didn’t look like my parents. Now I wonder: What did they do? Did they scavenge me? Build me from parts? Did someone wish for me at an altar? Ask the Mother Star for a mechanical girl, don’t make her too smart or she’ll figure it out? Anyways.
People from your half of the world look at at those of us who settled in the mountains and the basin, and then you look farther north at the Han Republic. You see the same faces and you hear the same language. But our similarities end there. A dozen societies live in the lands that border the Han. Some have spirit-dancers who draw fire through the air with acetylene torches. Some cook their food by burying it in the hot sands of the desert and eat only at night. We were just a small town of farmers and fishermen. Boring compared to the dancers and the nomads. Then your Union reconditioned an orbital access in the mountains and for a while we grew and became a trading outpost.
You asked about the man whose badge I had? His name is Arwin. My *koh* from back home. Em-*je*, you could explain the word *koh* better than me. An elder boy, a neighbor. His family and mine were close but he was not a relation. When I was younger I could outrun all the other children playing foxes-and-hens in the fields. Just pull away like a breeze and leave them clutching at empty air. Only Arwin could catch me and I loved to make him chase me down, overcome my feints and dodges, tackle me and pin me to the ground before I would yield. He almost saved me once, when I was a child. After the occupation we traveled together, from Midia to Clu and finally to *Nereid*. All the time we kept saving each other and costing each other dearly. I couldn’t tell you who he is anymore. Only that we were both from the same place.
When I was ten the Han armies came on foot over the crest of the northeastern ridge. They didn’t bring any technology. They led pack animals up the shipping routes, starting at Ror Else and snaking up the Hadu range. I heard that they looked like a plague. A mass of black uniforms washing across the land, marching with banners of blue and yellow. Even the mists of the mountains parted when they came, like an ill omen.
My mother and I were in the market square where crimson silk rippled overhead. Walking under them was like being immersed underwater. A maze of sunlight and shadow. My mother loved to browse, to hold up dress after dress against me and inspect the results. Why did I need to try so many different clothes, I would say. Just pick the prettiest one and buy five or six. Sometimes she got tired of my mouth and sent me to wait in the street. She did that day. I didn’t mind. 
I liked to lie on the cobblestone wall and look up at the sky for signs of aircraft. Flyers or scouts from the Mother-city. Even their contrails excited me. I was such a simple child. My father and I flew in a scout once, with two of his old students who had become Union pilots. We made it halfway to the moon and I could look back and see our home in the grey peaks under the clouds, the coastline where the land bordered the ocean. But by the time the Han came the orbital had been closed and traffic was grounded and nobody from the Union came to visit us anymore. 
All around me children shouted in the market. A toddler girl with sprouts of hair was running in the street among wooden produce carts that crunched across the stones. I picked her up and her brothers came, silently. They looked at me. 
Something was strange. The people had stopped, and their voices hushed and disappeared. Only one voice remained, coming from the far side of the street. The girl’s family asked me what was happening. I told them I didn’t know and I handed them their sister. I was frightened. I pulled my mother out of the store by her elbow. From the street we saw a young man standing on the other side of the square. A field hand still in his work tunic, white-faced and sweating. He was saying: *Hundreds—thousands maybe.*
And a fat vendor shouted from his stall: *They have no interest in us! Why should we believe you?*
The children beside me said: *We’re being invaded.* 
I hushed them and told them not to say such foolish things.
*Asha,* my mother called. She told me to come, sternly, and said that we were going home. A stream of people were already leaving the market. Home. I thought of my father and whether he had heard the warning. And I pictured him, at his study, his plants in front of him like a row of tiny green exclamation marks. A shiny waterfall of dust and sunlight from his window. When he heard the clamor, would he fold his glasses neatly and come and look for us at the market square, calling our names? No, I thought. If he found us he’d come straight at us and appear in our path like magic. My father *was* magic, you see. I had believed that since he showed me the sky beyond our own.
We dropped our packages and ran very quickly. I watched my mother outpace me in a full-length jinna dress. Her strides were long and measured, her form almost serene. I saw then how much of my blood had come from her. Or so I believed. I could run from the blackness of the forests at the north edge of town, past the windmills and factories, around the ring road and down to the farms in a single afternoon but my mother . . . she was faster.
I stayed with her. The streets were still and eerie, and dark wrought-iron signs swung from their posts in front of tradesmen’s shops. The sun was a cauldron of white-hot light. I fell on a curb, scraped my palms and shins, but my mother picked me up and told me it was only blood. I faltered a few steps and we ran once more.
Arwin met us in the boulevard. Later I thought, maybe it would have been better if he had not found us that day. He could have found someone else, maybe a less troublesome girl, escaped with her and started a new generation in some other place. Or at least he could have escaped alone. Intact, the way he was. A fourteen-year-old boy with a skinny face and a lanky frame and muscles ropey but powerful from chopping firewood. 
He turned us back. Told us that the way home was overrun and our quarter was already under siege. Under siege. He said it so calmly, like a fact. I could barely stand. It was as though the ground underneath me had given way and I was in freefall. I looked to him, then to my mother and back again, but they were both powerless.
My mother held me close and whispered something. I couldn’t hear what she said. Then she told Arwin: *Remember what we planned. South.* Before I could think of what any of this meant he pulled me away and we ran, down a narrow alley filled with clotheslines and metal balconies where the ground was still wet from the morning rain. It was all a blur, a glare of sun in the sky and reflections on the ground, a rush of stone and metal inches by my head.
After some distance I noticed my mother wasn’t with us and turned around. The street behind was empty and long with shadows. *Stop! Stop! We have to go back!* I cried. I started to run but he took my wrist with ferocious strength and yanked, and I toppled to the ground like a rag doll.
*No,* he said, *We have to leave town.*
Immediately I stood to struggle but something about the cadence of his voice and the pallor of his face gave me pause. He wasn’t calm after all; he was scared. Trembling in the wake of a greater beast. I realized that I would never convince him to let me go so I stomped my foot deep into his gut and escaped when he doubled over.
I ran back the way we came, then turned down the central boulevard, limping and unsteady. My mind was oversaturated and the town would not stop spinning. I could hear him behind me, calling my name, maybe fifty paces, gaining. There was no sign of my mother, of anyone. As the red roofs flew by me in a blur I smelled smoke, thick and acrid. A sound came next, a metallic sound like a hammer on an anvil. There were shouts behind me. I turned around to see Arwin in the hands of three Han guards, three tiny men in dark, terrible uniforms. Military jackets with leather epaulets and hats like flight controller helmets. More of them got me. Tackled me from behind, then covered my mouth and tied me like a hog. 
It would be another two years before we could escape. Others had parents struck down with clubs or shot with rifles that day. My mother just disappeared. I often think of her whisper and what it could have meant. Two syllables. A word, something like *masa*. Not many Han words sound like that. Maybe *behave,* or maybe *survive.*
---- 
The Han grouped the children into camps they called schoolhouses. In reality they were giant wooden barns where the shadows stretched to infinity. I was a first-child. After working all the children in the field for the day they made first-children caretakers of the younger ones. Even the newborn infants that were our half-siblings: the product between the soldiers and the women of Midia. We were separated from our parents, separated from all the adults, living in the farms at the edge of town. A distance I could have covered in less than an hour, normally.
The Han didn’t believe in family. They cared only for their revolution, for the glory of planetfall, the glory of their new republic. They tried to indoctrinate us but every morning as they made us pray to their cause I could only wonder what kind of revolutionary made children do all the work. But I didn’t dare ask. I already had a taste of broken ribs earlier that year when one of my charges escaped in the night and ran to the end of the road for a drink of water. How hard did they kick me to break me, I wonder?
Others suffered worse. A girl from our town named Min, an absolutely beautiful girl, attracted the advances of one of the commandants. He tried to make her take his name, promising her that she’d be rescued, purified. She refused. In retaliation he drowned a boy from her schoolhouse in the Cha’el river and saw that she was punished for his death. When they took her eye they gathered all of us to make an example of her. Min-*je* was a sticky bawling horror and when they threw the eye among us we parted like a crater.
I didn’t grow an inch in those two years. We had no meat, no protein. Around the same time I got my first blood I started to wet the bed. I wondered how long I would last, how long a body could live as a bag of bones and organs.
Sometimes hidden among our rations of root vegetables and flour there would be fish. Big ones, ten kilos or more, all wrapped and tied like gifts. I had to resist the urge to tear them apart and eat them raw. We had to chop them away from the kitchen, up in the lofts, and burn the bones carefully when we were done. The elder boys of Midia must have caught the fish in the Cha’el. I can’t imagine how great a risk they took. They went at night when the blood moon came out and the Han relaxed their patrols. We think the blood moon is just a superstition but the Han are deeply reverent of it. You must think us both backwards; afraid of a simple meteorological event.
Late in the second year of the occupation I was moved to work in the textile plant, where I was no longer a first-child but instead shared a dormitory room with ten others my age. Everything was metal in that building: corrugated roof and walls. Panels and studs bigger than my fist. It was full of pressure doors and valves and you could hear steam hissing at night. Sometimes the girls jostled each other, or held each other and prayed. I would close my eyes and imagine I was aboard a Leviathan drifting into the universe, getting smaller and smaller, shrinking to the size of a pinpoint star, then becoming a singularity.
One night, in the last blood moon of that year, Arwin appeared at the door to my room. We hadn’t spoken during the occupation, not even once. No words and no footsteps preceded him; he was just there. He called me out, gestured silently while looking about himself, and I went in only my nightgown so I wouldn’t arouse suspicion. I dreaded what he might have said to me. What revenge he might have had in mind. I thought he blamed me for his failure to escape two years ago and his captivity ever since. But I went anyways. I felt he had the right to do to me whatever he wanted.
But he called me asha and asked if I was well-treated and led me to the end of a corridor with a round window like a porthole. We kneeled in the red light. He had started to grow a beard but it was uneven and his face was scarred and even thinner than before. I put my hand on his cheek and he looked so much like he used to that I might have started to cry.
He said that we had to leave that very night. He asked if I could still run. Outside was the burnt sky and before long the moon would appear. He wanted me to help gather the girls. Swiftly, calmly. Then we would run in the moonlight through the fields, follow the Cha’el south through the mountain passes that led to the station at Eyl Menda. From there we would follow the tracks to Eyl Targa, where we could cross the border to Clu.
Wait, I told him. The Han had their beliefs but they’d chase us through the fields just the same. Even if they didn’t catch us, for something like this they’d slaughter our families, or the families of ten random children.
And he tried to look at me but he had to look away. He told me that we were burning the town that night. Not them. Us. Who could have known when the Han came over the hills that they’d take so much? I didn’t understand back then. I begged him to say it wasn’t so, as though it were under his control. I begged and I pleaded but he was as helpless as me. It was only an edict for him to obey: run. Gather as many as he could, and run. 
He and the other elder children were charged with our escape. Some were not as stealthy as him it seemed. As I kneeled in that circle of moonlight with Arwin’s clothes in my fists the sirens came, like the caws of some demented bird. Before we could rouse any of the girls, before I could think, we had to react. This time I told him, I would do it. I would do anything he said.
We ran from room to room, to the confused girls who sat in their sheets like gophers sniffing the air, looking this way and that. Some appeared at the doorframes trailing their long nightgowns and poked their faces out. I lied to each one of them, told them there was a fire, told them to leave the building and run. Following Arwin’s lead I told them to head south along the Cha’el to the station. So they ran, covering their ears. They ran like flowing phantasms down the halls, over the catwalks, climbing out windows. The moonlight and the wind shaped their clothes into flames.
When I reached the end of the hallway I turned back and ran out the front door. It had been pulled open wide in its rusted tracks. I was skinnier at twelve than I was at ten, and I hadn’t run in years, but as I burst into the night with the wild grasses under my feet I started overtaking people. We were all sturdy children, used to making our way across the terrain. They ran well that night, though in the end not a single one of them made it.
As I crossed the row of metal pumps midway through the field there came the smell of smoke again. Pebbles scraped the soles of my feet and thorns scratched at my shins. If you’ve never seen the blood moon in the mountains, it’s bright. So bright that I could navigate to the Cha’el even in the thick darkness underfoot.
Then I heard shots, and more shots. Uneven, without tempo. Many rifles, many soldiers. It seems they didn’t want to chase us in the moonlight, after all. Instead they gunned us down. I saw a girl running beside me suddenly arch her back and fall to the ground.
As I ran I found that the crowd around me was thinning and I had overtaken almost everybody. Still, I pumped my legs, felt my blood and my heart for the first time in years. I saw a ravine like a nest in the earth and I dove for cover. Water came up to my ankles inside. Cold, flowing water. I had made it to the Cha’el. When I looked back, the town was glowing orange in the black swollen land. It was like the dying embers of a campfire, so weak, so impotent. 
The field was lit clearly by the neon moon but I could see no one. I was alone in the smell of the smoke and the rush of acid in my muscles. I remember the sirens calling, calling. More gunshots, but far away.
I bundled the soaked nightgown against my chest and walked the Cha’el all night in my underclothes. Before dawn the burnt sky came again and it became brown like a dust storm. I saw the station, Eyl Menda, its raised platform above the tracks with a bright edge, low buildings with flat awnings and spikes of towers and pipes. 
He was there. Somehow he beat me there. It was only the two of us. We hid and waited all morning for others but none came. We had to leave. I asked him why they burned the town. He said he didn’t know. I asked if anyone could still be alive. He didn’t answer. We spent all day walking along the tracks, stepping in gravel and wood. He gave me wildflowers along the way to distract me. I picked off the petals and ate them one at a time.
---- 
When we arrived in Clu Uthuz we didn’t leave the seaside for almost a week. We scavenged for food and ate very little. Berries, fronds. Many days passed for us walking in the sand, listening to the sea’s distant ovation. The sky was cream and the water azure but the land and everything on it was horribly gray. At night we sat by a brittle log, throwing rocks into the waves, watching the world turn orange and blue, fade to darkness and back again. We needed no fire. The two of us, aliens in a warm but foreign land.
People approached us, at first dark-skinned children, curious at our filthy clothes. Then their parents came: six or seven chubby, middle-aged villagers. They wore surprisingly little and spoke so differently that I could barely understand them at first. I learned, slowly, but Arwin never did. The Clu tribesmen took care of us, fed us, invited us to their homes. Round little huts of concrete and straw, strewn with fishing nets and pikes. Their whole village by the shore, connected with wooden piers and boardwalks. 
Arwin learned to fish. He went out with them on their yachts and dragged netfuls of harlequin tuna from the sea. I helped care for the children. They were kind and respectful but they climbed on everything. Furniture, rocks, the shoals by the farthest piers. Even me. Together we worked for room and board at a local hostel. When travelers came from the Hadu regions I would help translate. It was good to feel useful.
In a few weeks our time started to pass in a manner other than despair. We shared our culture with our hosts. Told them our stories. I drew patterns for jinnas for them to sew and Arwin brewed his moonshine. When we got drunk he’d dance with a gourd of wine in each hand and I’d laugh so hard that I’d fall over. Sometimes I would think that those dances and spirits only existed in the two of us. It was a very lonely thought.
After a year I felt the air change. I told Arwin, thinking myself mad, but he felt it too. He said that the sea was in a frenzy every day, the wind wicked its surface into jagged points and it turned black like onyx. Em-*je*, have you heard of the saying, *hoh-on-ji?* “Children of the wind and waves.” People who live in a turbulent time: that was us, and we were at everyone’s mercy. I convinced him to leave and we went south. During our journey we heard that several outposts had reported Han scouts as far as Eyl Menda. The Han overran the rest of Hadu within weeks, and eventually Clu as well.
---- 
We made it to your country, to the Union recruitment center at Yor, and we enlisted. Planetfall seemed trillions of miles away and the promise of being fed and clothed and sheltered was all that mattered to us. I so desperately wanted to fly but it was impossible for me to enter the academy. We thought we knew was it meant to live in a strange land, but Yor was different. Neither of us could imagine.
In the city, when the moon turned to blood, crowds of nameless boys and girls would run through the streets, the courtyards, the beaches. In my downtime I would join them. Bonfires taller than people would light the shores of the river. Each fire was an altar, a tiny burning sun, drawing us into orbits, around the flames, around the music, around each other. The river was thick and glistened with reflections from the city. Sometimes a steamy rain fell without cloud, long slashes of water making craters in the sand. The whole beach filled with the scent of tobacco and sweet camphor combined with perfume. I loved to feel the bass of the music kick me in the belly and watch the night fill with thousands upon thousands of eyes.
Arwin stayed with our own kind. Ate his meals with them, drank with them, heard nothing but their songs. His friends were from villages among the Hadu mountains: the young and the crazy, the fat and the old, servicemen and site workers. When we met, they sat around me in a circle as though assessing the purity of my blood. By then I had spent so long with outlanders—the Han, the Clu, and the Union—that I spoke with an accent. They didn’t believe me at first when I told them where I was from.
Still, Arwin was my *koh*. He hadn’t chased me for a long time but he still called me asha and asked if the outlanders were treating me all right. Even though I didn’t care for his friends as much as he did they saw me as a sister and a daughter. They would call me over and tell me their stories of their homes and families and how they did not understand life in Yor. Some of them, the enlisted ones, would eventually join us on *Nereid*.
---- 
Aboard ship he and I went our separate ways mostly. For two years I threw myself at my work and my studies. I had just finished flight school as we approached orbit and he came to see me in my tiny compartment. We sat on my cot and the fluorescents drew green and yellow all over the walls and deep shadows on his face. He wanted to tell me something.
His friends aboard ship called themselves the Unwanted, he explained. The Unwanted who would pay back the Han for what they did to our homes. They wanted to steal agile gunships and cross over to *Waterfall* hiding in the shadow of an equipment rotation convoy. He took me in his arms and painted such a scene. They would devour the Han ship from the inside, from deep within its hangar. Pump round after round into its sanctum until their batteries ran dry. At some point they would spin around and make a run back out into the black, chased by fire and decompression and flakes of superstructure exploding like dried chaff. They would leave the Han ship burning in space like a volcano and stop their spread to the new world.
*We may not survive,* he said. *But Waterfall must die.*
It was so strange. So strange. I couldn’t begin to think what had become of him. 

On her last night with them and her last night aboard, she hid with six of them in the dorsal landing bay under cover of a bank of flyers. At the mouth of the bay laughter and music echoed from a company of techs, many of them former workers of the land who used any excuse to celebrate: ticking off the light-years, equinoxes in their old home, solstices in the new. Behind the crowd, at the maw of the bay, a hideous distortion blind blotted out the starscape. A precaution against prying eyes from *Waterfall.*
As she approached with the Unwanted, hidden under a grey metal canopy of wings, a distant halo flared around the company from the halogens low in the deck. She realized this was C company, *her* former company, and stopped. Arwin noticed this too and took her by the waist, pulled her close and said *what luck!* before going with the men to hide among the pumps and loaders on the far side of the bay.
She changed clothes with an older girl named Bola from the Clu lowlands. Clouds of neon steam lit their bare skin a deep purple. Bo-*je* leaned over to step into her dress, her breasts hanging down like inverted hills that came to points, humming a Haduan wedding song. As Sara stood thinking that the girl had some nerve to sing at a time like this, Bo-*je* cast her a defiant gaze before striking off. *Wait for my signal. Be a good girl.* She receded into the vast bronze dome of the bay, a fluttering pyramid of black hair atop a plain white dress. She struck an elegant gait, one foot before the other, snaking her way around cables and fuel lines.
Sara made her way to the barrel-shaped still and grabbed a stein from the mismatched selection at its base. She poured one full cup and knocked it back, felt a trail of clear liquid run down the sides of her chin, down her neck and into her cleavage.  She would have welcomed the urge to vomit but it didn’t come. The company cavorted around her and hollered at a game of dice. Soon she grew restless and moved to a large expanse of deck that was cleared of birds, where boys threw girls up into the air, then caught them by the waist and set them back down. Dancing, she wouldn’t mind dancing, to give her something to do while waiting for Bo-*je*’s goddamned signal.
She let herself stumble and sway, demure with wine. She approached Petr, a meek city-boy wearing the simple gray jacket of a cadet. Petr, face like a tall inverted triangle, a shock of blond hair, acne dotting his nose and mouth. He had fought in the streets and alleys back home in the Mother-city, to the east of the Grey where the city bordered the scrapyards and junkheaps. He could take a slug to the face like a champion but look at him now, frozen in place by a cheap cotton *dai,* a little leg and a little shoulder.
*Why you wearing a dress?*
*Lost a bet,* she answered, and offered him a long ghostly arm. They shoved off into the dance floor together, not with the ravenous torque that she had expected, but gently with his hand at her waist. He didn’t look at her much, just spun and stepped, over and over. Their timing was off, but she paid no attention the music anyways.
*This is all fucked up,* she thought. *Maybe Waterfall makes it down to Nor and the Han gain a foothold but we’re not just farmers and fishermen and they can’t just bully us anymore.*
She took Petr’s hands in a wide centripetal spin, felt her dress flare and threw her head back in a piercing girlish squeal. Around her the world became a carousel of colors studded with rings of light. Voices erupted, shouts and cheers in Gerund, and she realized that she could understand the conversations without trying anymore.
*When did that happen?* she wondered.
A pair of hands found their way to her shoulders and she started, guilty before she had even acted, but her captor only drew his arm around her and raised a mug with his other. Petr backed away, smiling, and he clapped, along with everyone else. Her old tech lead Mark had her in his arm. He called to the company and they stared back bedazzled. Sara looked up to his full red beard and balding head standing a full foot taller than she.
*Fellas, fellas!* he shouted. *Ladies too. Look who we have here. Come to say goodbye.* And he smiled at her, shook her in his grasp, his teeth white and straight. He’d never smiled before, certainly not at some lowly runner who spent her days harnessed to some scaffolding or grimy fuselage. He was drunk, she realized.
The company cheered. *Give ’em hell!*
*We wish her good luck,* Mark continued, *as her body joins her head up in the clouds, and hope that the flight corps can, on occasion, get a decent day’s work out of her.* He laughed and the crowd did too. As they raised their cups to *Sara!* her own laugh shot out of her unexpectedly and her hands came to her mouth only too slow to contain it. She squinted and the pinpoints of lanternlight became drowning crystalline forms.
*I’m so goddamned proud of you,* he said to her, and as he spoke the music and lights faded away and she felt herself falling weightless. Ozone tingled in the air while unseen quills perforated her extremities and she realized she had fallen. It was peaceful. People ran toward her, vibrating the metal grating  of the deck like a snare. As the world grew heavy, she wondered whether she would die, and whether she would make a pretty corpse.
Not a corpse, also not alive. Something else entirely. Back on the hilltop on the surface of Nor she stared dazed at her hand, thoughts of her transformation skipping through her mind, threatening to congeal into lucidity but losing shape and traction. Was this a punishment from the Mother Star? A divine justice from Nor itself? Or had she always been this way, a curiosity, an aberration, a machine shaped like a girl, running through the cobblestone streets of Midia?
