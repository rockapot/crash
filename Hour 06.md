### Hour 06
Hours after the first wave, a pair of junior engineers arrived, followed soon by four more. Quickly all six of them set about reviving the hold’s atmosphere pumps to deliver heat. They dangled upside-down on lines overhead working their jumpstarts until all the units hummed simultaneously and blasted air downward to the deck. In a brief celebration they hooted into their headsets.
Crushed it.
They online? came a female voice yelling hard over the wind.
They’re on the grid. Come on in, you earned your pay.
Roger.
They set themselves down and climbed out of their harnesses. Once out they were nothing more than a lot of skinny kids. The grizzled builders gave them funny looks and thanked them for the heat but went on anyways stacking crates along the entrance. One of the noncomm engineers took duty and gathered all their gear and when he counted it up he called over the two oldest juniors. The juniors were barely seventeen, one tall and blond and bucktoothed, the other with unruly dark hair.
You’re short one set of tethers and one lancer.
Someone forgot to check in sir?
You tell me.
Who’d have a lancer? the dark-haired one asked the other.
Five-six. She was running the line outside.
He opened the line on his headset. Five-six Five-six. Front and center.
Five-six, you respond.
Alys, where the hell are you?
Alys?
