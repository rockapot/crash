A heavy cruiser from mankind’s last colony crashes near the southern pole of Nor, an desolate ghost-world on the edge of the frontier. David and Emily survive the crash and make their way across the wasteland to regroup with the shipwrecked crew. They encounter Sara, a badly injured young woman who must come to terms with the realization that she isn’t human.
As they travel together, each of them discovers a terrifying connection with the technology on the alien world. They encounter threats both ancient and modern, uncover conspiracies within the ranks of survivors, and mourn the loss of family left behind. Their journey is a personal tale of survival, a race against an oppressive political superpower, and a struggle for the future of humanity on the desolate surface of Nor.
