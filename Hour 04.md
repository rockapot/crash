### Hour 04
The cargo hold was a hundred-meter-long section of *Nereid*’s superstructure shaped like a maggot with a cornucopia maw at one end several stories tall. During troposphere entry it appeared to have separated and touched down, carving an icy ravine behind it. They walked along its wake where flash-melted waves of ice had re-frozen into skyward fingers almost as tall as the hold itself. A twisted forest cast a long blue shadow. Within the maw, a ruined mass of girders and jagged metal. Fountains of sparks like fireworks. Along its path a trail of cargo containers, shipping crates, netting, and machinery upended in the ice as though floating in a frozen sea.

Two bearded engineers welcomed them and held the ropes and she climbed ahead, past twisted claws of metal. He went next and after he made it panting over the lip of the deck all twenty-strong survivors around them gave them a brief standing ovation.

Soon they learned that those same engineers had found the cargo hold early in Nor’s daycycle and hotwired a personal transmitter to its spire for continuous broadcast. Being the seniormost noncommissioned officers they also took duty and directed the salvage operations of the day.
Survival gear was plentiful, as were emergency blankets. *Nereid* has been well-equipped to fight the cold. Donning this gear the crew hauled out the worst of the wreckage. The contents of the hold were mostly prefabricated housing intended for planetside residence like quick-setup shelters for settlers back home. They considered setting one up but quickly determined that the structures would not have been sound in the ice or snow or the metal of the deck. But their parts were useful as scaffolding to set up dividers and screens, and a primitive set of windblocking corridors along the maw. The gel in the hold’s power relays was an economic means of combustion and they set about arranging barrels of blue flame and metal crates to stave off the elements. It was sinful to burn it in this manner, he thought. How many megajoules wasted.
During the work he traded stories with the builders and the four apprentice engineers but none of them knew what had brought about the ship’s demise. Just a sudden darkness and weightlessness followed by loss of attitude control.
Something’s after us, they said.
Something beyond time.
The Eater of Worlds.
Demon Moon and Mother Star, protect us.
But the duty engineers discouraged speculation among the crew. They set them on clearing girders and taking inventory and other forms of essential busywork. 
During a smoke break by the maw he pulled her aside and they gazed out at the stark white now turning slowly to grey.
You believe this horseshit?
She accepted the burning cigarette but it went out by the time she brought it to her lips. She shook her head.
Such is fate.
Don’t tell me you’d cast your lot with them.
You should try believing in something other than yourself for a change.
When I find something worthwhile.
Don’t you realize where we are?
She sheltered the cigarette with one hand as she brought it back to life. He leaned on a precarious railing. A metallic groan arose from all around.
