## Space
Why did God make space?
I asked my mother when I was little. Playing at her knee, looking into the skies. I was such a stubborn child but my mother could make me do anything. She told me stories about our world, about its people and their origins. So strange and vivid were her tales that sometimes I think she was working her will in me all along. She wanted me on the *Nereid* mission. She wanted a daughter on the new world. A pilgrim, a pioneer, a curse-breaker. Bearing a torch among the crazy and wonderful. So she told me what I needed to hear.
My mother told me, to understand why God made space, you must consider why God made sand.
When God made sand, Man rose from the oceans and walked upon it, claiming the shore, saying this world, the world above—it belongs to me now. And he filled his lungs with air and spat it at God, knowing nothing of his place in creation.
So God made trees to hold back the sand. And filled them with the predators of the world, giving them claws and fangs and ferocity beyond what Man could achieve. Now, what is this? said Man. Such a perimeter will not contain me. And he fought the beasts and burned the forest and felled the trees to make his home, and the smoke rose high, to the very place of God. 
Then God created the plain and caused the world to stretch leagues in every direction. And Man found himself scattered among the lands. So Man enslaved the beasts of the fields and rode them across the distances. Threw his fists up at God shouting I will cross the lands and make them mine. Next came the seas and the sky and the mountain, and with each creation Man built his response. Devices to float, to scale, to fly. He would not be bound by the will of God. He thought himself equal in God.
In the face of such a creature as Man, and all he had done, God made space. And Man, in his custom, set out to conquer it. How weak the stars were. How placid the night. This would be no challenge, not after the beasts or the raging waters or the craggy peaks. But space was not the likes of the waters or the lands. Or anything in the world of Man. Space was the majesty of creation in its purest form. Man could throw the sum total of his years at the void and the void would only consume them. Emptiness and terror and lawlessness. At last Man understood his place.
Although my mother didn’t believe in the God of the Mother-city or the Star of the Han, she told me this and many other things. She helped me to look up and beyond and set me on a road that brought me to *Nereid* and to planetfall. 
But now, after all that’s happened,
