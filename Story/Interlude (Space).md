## Space
Why did God make space?
I asked my mother when I was little. Playing at her knee, looking into the skies. I though myself a stubborn child but my mother could make me do anything. She told me stories about our world, about its people and their origins. So strange and vivid were her tales that sometimes I think she was working her will in me all along. She wanted me on the *Nereid* mission. She wanted a daughter on the new world. A pilgrim, a pioneer, a curse-breaker. Bearing a torch among the crazy and wonderful. So she told me what I needed to hear.
My mother told me, to understand why God made space, you must consider why God made sand.
When God made sand, Man rose from the oceans and walked upon it, claiming the shore, saying this world, the world above—it belongs to me now. And he filled his lungs with air and spat it at God, knowing nothing of his place in creation.
So God made trees to hold back the sand. And filled them with the predators of the world, giving them claws and fangs and ferocity. Now, what is this? said Man. Such a perimeter will not contain me. And he fought the beasts and burned the forest and felled the trees to make his home, and the smoke rose high, to the very place of God. 
Then God created the plain and caused the world to stretch leagues in every direction. And Man found himself scattered among the lands. So Man enslaved the beasts of the fields and rode them across the distances. Threw his fists up at God shouting I will cross the lands and make them mine. Next came the seas and the skies and the mountains, and with each creation Man built his response. Devices to float, to scale, to fly. He would not be bound by the will of God. He thought himself equal to God.
In the face of such a creature, God made space. And Man, in his custom, set out to conquer it. How weak the stars were. How placid the night. This would be no challenge, not after the raging waters or the craggy peaks. But space was not the likes of the waters or the lands. Or anything in the world of Man. Space was the majesty of creation in its purest form. Man could throw the sum total of his years at the void and the void would only consume him. At last Man understood his place.
Or so my mother said.
I believe something else. *Nereid* came to this world seeking to colonize it, seeking to learn what had happened to the rest of humanity. Why mankind disappeared, all except our own lonely colony. After we crashed and lost so many to the horrors of this place, I don’t believe that God made space to demonstrate our hubris. I believe he made space to protect us. He laid the infinities between the stars but it wasn’t enough. It wasn’t enough.
