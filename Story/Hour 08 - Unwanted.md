## Unwanted
### Hour 08
She poked out from the hovel where the medic had left her. A rush of people. Faces. Many bearded, unkempt, beady with moisture. In uniforms and bulkier clothing like arctic gear. Capes? No, blankets, draped about their bodies like friar monks or pilgrims. On some of the larger men a glint of metal arm. A hand replaced by a saw blade or starcross. Two men, walking by with a metal girder slung over their shoulders, a girder so long as to resemble a train. All around a huddled crowd, some lined up with vessels in their hands as though in supplication. The rank of command gone. Officers, crewmen, builders in crisscrossing streams. A few voices, shouting in urgency. Speaking Gerund. So much profanity as to admit no other words. All of it bathed in an afterglow like a festival. Even strings of lights on metal trellises above them. Lights that doubled and redoubled and pushed her flat to the ground with no arms to break her fall. She landed hard on the hollow mesh. She had to urinate desperately but could not undress.
