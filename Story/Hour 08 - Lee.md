### Hour 08
A fine mist of blood clouded Mica’s scopes, her face, all of her. Dripping across her forehead and into her sputtering mouth. She turned frantically between Em and her patient. She was wrist-deep in a gash on the inner thigh of a crewman trying to clamp his femoral. He was well-built but thin, stripped down to his skivvies.
“Em, help me close!”
Em grabbed the protoplaser with both hands and hefted it across the deck. A blessed working unit scavenged with the last round of survivors. She clunked it down in the vee of the boy’s legs and started to focus. A spotlight swung briefly overhead before leaving the deck in the waxy yellow glow of lanterns and mirrors.
“Clamp it.” 
Blood continued to well.
“Harder!”
“I know!” Mica yelled back.
“I mean it!”
Finally she could see the rupture and brought the plaser's arm to bear. She checked its reserve. Barely a quarter left. She pulled her own scopes down from her forehead, then leaned in close over the boy’s other leg, guiding the plaser arm with both hands.
“Locked. Burning!”
She fired and the air filled with a rude buzz and a white-hot light. They both squinted behind their scopes, Mica having the luxury of looking away. Em’s hair fell in front of her face and she felt dangerously close to singeing it off.
“Looks good. I’ve got a seal and it’s holding. I’m going to extend. Clear.”
“Do it!” Mica removed her hands and Em started tracking the plaser millimeter by painstaking millimeter, reaching beyond the arc to guide the deep tissue mend. The scent of cauterized flesh filled the air, acrid, chemical. Her fingers grew hot through her calluses in proximity to the needle-sharp beam but she endured. After an agonizing minute her hands and wrists cramped and she felt she would go blind even from behind the protection of her scopes. Finally the repair was done and she cut the plaser.
Mica closed him with thirty staples leaving a sawtoothed suture. The boy was pale and sweaty, his pulse racing and blood pressure low.
“Check the donor pool. He’s going to need . . . Mica, are you listening?”
“You’re bleeding. Your nose.”
Em brought her aching finger to her face and pulled it away bloody. She looked down. Dark graceful splotches ran down the front of her fatigues like inkblots. She felt lightheaded and unsteady. Spry Mica was already at her side, guiding her gently to the deck. The toothy mesh dug into her hand. She chided herself for forgetting her gloves.
“How many reds did you *take*?” Mica asked, handing her some gauze.
“Two or three. Per hour.”
“God, how are you not in arrest?”
“I come from a long line of addicts.”
“Not funny, miss.”
“I’m fine.”
“Stay down until your system is clear.”
“Can’t order me. You’re . . . underclassman.”
“I got this.” Mica stood up and walked over to a crate and wheeled a plasma tank over. Em stood and followed.
“Is that the right hemotype—” Em took the catheter from the tank but suddenly forgot what she was about to do with it.
“Stop. Any more and I tell the old man. How many shifts in a row is this for you?” Mica took the catheter from her and turned the boy’s forearm anterior side up. “Get out, lie low, and take a rest.”
“You need to tie him off.”
“I know how to run a line, miss. Out.”

She left a bloody handprint on the tarp. The sheets delimiting the operating rooms swayed gently while grotesque machinations  continued behind them. The streak from a surgeon’s headlamp dashed across a surface. A bonesaw spun up.
Casualties, still coming in this late after the crash. Fresh ones too, with injuries consistent with high-speed impact and burns and a few cases of crush syndrome. Fisk hadn’t emerged from his operating tent yet. Still cutting or drilling or sawing away at something. The residents called him the watchmaker. He didn’t use scopes, only spectacles and his naked eyes. He threatened that morning to outlive them all and it looked like he just might.
The girl. The armless girl. Em forced her thoughts into a bundle and tried to orient herself. The hold seemed to have grown. Since last time the lights had moved, the boxes had moved. Clusters of people migrated. She started to wander, to stick her neck out and look for the familiar jacket she’d given away but she didn’t get far before a man pulled at her sleeve.
Please help her. Her leg is broken. Nobody’s seen us yet, it’s been hours.
How to set a leg. How to tie a line.
