## Unwanted
### Hour 09
*Good and merciful Mother. When the Moon fell in love with a Star. Is this real? Or a vision of the Demon’s world? Look at this ship. This crew. Just wreckage now, all of it. Spread-eagle on tables fighting to stay alive. Darkness and soot and blood and metal. Our light, dying. Maybe dead already.*
*And you. Someone did this to you. Turned you into some kind of machine. Opened you up and hollowed you out, heart and all. You heard that medic. Poor girl, being trampled underfoot. She can’t be much older than you are, not with an apprentice pin on her collar. But look how she fights! Her nails are crusted with blood and her eyes are dark with exhaustion and she shakes like a rabbit seeing these things all around her, but still she goes on.*
*What did she call you? Asha. Are you asha to her? Crying among the boxes. Throwing up and passing out. You can’t even hold your hair out of your vomit. Why would anyone build a machine that could throw up?*

*They hollowed you up and scooped you out, replaced your body with metal and machine. Maybe they wanted to control you. To use you. But you’re still in control. You can think and act on your own. You have  Everyone has their battles and you’re no different.
*Look at these people around you. Look at your ship. Just wreckage now, all of it. And your shipmates—former shipmates—spread-eagle on tables fighting to stay alive. Others like that doctor. That poor girl, being trampled underfoot. She can’t be much older than you are, not with an apprentice pin on her collar. But look how she fights! Her nails crusted and flaky with blood. She shakes like a rabbit seeing these things all around her, but she goes on.
*You’ve had your cries but now it’s time to get up. What do you know?
*One. You crashed on the surface of Nor, you and all civilian and military hands. The crash happened some time in the last daycycle. The ship is gone, it sounds like. This is all that’s left of her. What happened? Were we attacked? Did she fly apart?
*And where were you through it all? Why don’t you remember?
*Two. You’ve lost your arms. Your right one to the shoulder and your left one above the elbow. There’s a sensation of injury but it’s not pain. It’s—awareness? Not pleasant but bearable. Your body giving its polite dissent. Your forehead feels like it’s split open but she told you it was fine. Your left eye is swollen shut. You’re missing a lot of skin. On your sides and back where she didn’t look. But your legs and feet are still there, still healthy. You have no way to confirm, no way to undress, to take off your boots. So you have to take it on faith.
*Three. You are mechanical. A lot of you.
*Your arms.
*Your torso.
*Your organs and skull.
*Maybe all of you.
*This is probably what saved you. You’re only alive because of what you are. If a human—If a human went through what you did, they would not have survived. At the very least they would not be on their feet.
*You don’t feel mechanical. What did Mark say when he got his arm? “It’s like my skin is diamond and my hands weigh fifty pounds.” Heavy. You don’t feel that way. You are—were—covered in skin. That’s also unusual. Nobody would cover an industrial implant in skin. It would be an expensive waste. So someone built you ultralight implants and covered them in skin. Why do this to you? And how much did it cost? Who could afford such a thing? 
*Maybe they’re not implants.
*Maybe nobody did this to you.
*Little chickadee, what are you?
*No. That’s impossible. Think about it. You had parents. You grew up. Had fevers. Chills. Thrown up, bled, and now you have to pee. Could a machine do all of that?
*God I have to pee.
*No. Recovery period. There’s always a recovery period to getting implants. It makes sense. You’re basically amputating a limb. Mark was out three days. I should have been out at least that long.
*When was your last memory?
*Arwin came to see your new quarters. Congrats on making flight school. You told him not to look so surprised. Said you were a goddamn wizard. He told you not to get too full of yourself, that they were shitty quarters. Rust-green with a bare fluorescent bulb above a sink and mirror. Not even a commode. But still, your own quarters, your rusty bunk, your pipes that farted steam clouds. He was impressed. Even proud. That bunk—that was where you two made love. Was that a dream?
*Arwin! Is he down here? Did he make it?
*No. Later. Keep thinking.
*After that. The equinox. The dance on the hangar deck. You got drunk and Petr asked you why you were wearing a dress and you said you lost a bet. Kind of his way of extending an invitation. He spun you to and fro and the lights were up in the trellises kind of like they are now but less grotesque. There were white dresses on the girls and white lilies on the bulkheads and it all just blurred together like a stream of ghosts. Did he swing you into the forcefield? Motherfucker. That would put your lights out. 
*Mark? Petr? Are you here?
*How long has it been since the equinox?

Sara stumbled into the sails of cloth by the opening to the black beyond. No redshifted stars, just black, like the end of times. In the distance funnels of red and yellow fires lit the world. The soldiers and crewmen ran around her in their jumpsuits and fatigues, bearing equipment, buckets of water, wounded people. They argued for space on beds, on the floor, argued for right of way to the bonfires. Nobody noticed the odd sight, a limping Han girl in a prim officer’s coat and nonmatching fatigue leggings.
