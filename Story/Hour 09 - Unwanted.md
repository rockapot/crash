## Unwanted
### Hour 09
They’ve taken your body but you still have your mind. Look at these people around you. Look at your ship. Just wreckage now, all of it. And all of your shipmates—former shipmates—spread-eagle on tables fighting to stay alive. Others like that doctor. That poor girl. Being trampled underfoot. She can’t be much older than you are, not with an apprentice rank on her collar. But look how she fights too! Her nails crusted and flaky with blood, she shakes in her own boots like a rabbit, but she goes on.
So everyone has their battles. You’re no different from the rest. You’ve had your cries but now it’s up to you.
What do you know?
One. We crashed on the surface of Nor, some time in the last day-cycle. The ship is gone. Likely this is all that’s left of her. What happened? Were we attacked? Did she fly apart? Where was I? Why can’t I *remember?*
Two. You really have to pee. But you can’t. Which leads to:
Three. You’ve lost both your arms. Your right one to the shoulder and your left one above the elbow. You’re hurt elsewhere too but there’s no pain. There’s a sensation of injury but it’s not pain. It’s—awareness? Not pleasant but bearable. Your body politely asserting its distress. Your skull feels like it’s cracked but she told you it was fine. Your left eye is swollen shut. You’re missing a lot of skin under this jacket. A horrendous amount.  On your sides and back where the doctor didn’t look. But your legs and feet are still there, still healthy. You have no way to confirm, no way to undress, to take off your boots. Take it on faith, then.
Four. 
You are mechanical. A lot of you.
Your arms.
Your torso.
Your organs. Your skull.
Maybe all of you.
And this is what saved you. You’re only alive because of what you are. If a human—If a human went through what you did, they would not have survived.
You don’t feel mechanical. What did Mark say when he got his arm? “It’s like my skin is diamond and my hands weigh fifty pounds.” Heavy. You don’t feel that way. You are—were—covered in skin. That’s also unusual. Nobody would cover an industrial implant in skin. It would be an expensive waste. So someone built you ultralight implants and covered them in skin. Why do this to you? And how much did it cost? Who could afford such a thing? 
Maybe they’re not implants.
Maybe nobody did this to you.
Little chickadee, what the fuck are you?
No. That’s impossible. Think about it. You had parents. You grew up. Had fevers. Chills. Thrown up, bled, and now you have to pee. Could a machine do all of that?
God I have to pee.
No. Recovery period. There’s always a recovery period to getting implants. It makes sense. You’re basically amputating a limb. Mark was out three days. I should have been out at least that long.
When’s your last memory?
Arwin. Arwin came to see my new quarters. Congrats on making flight school. You told him not to look so surprised. Said you were a goddamn wizard. He told you not to get too full of yourself, that they were shitty quarters. Rust-green with a bare fluorescent bulb above a sink and mirror. Not even a commode. A rusty bunk and pipes that farted steam clouds. But still, your own quarters. He was impressed. Even proud. That bunk—that was where he fucked you.
Demons, he fucked you. Was that a dream?
Arwin? Are you down here? Did you make it?
No. Stop. Keep thinking.
After that. The equinox. The dance on the hangar deck. You got drunk and Petr asked you why you were wearing a dress and you said you lost a bet. Kind of his way of extending an invitation. And you spun to and fro and the lights were up in the trellises kind of like they are now but less grotesque and there were white dresses on the girls and white lilies and it all just blurred together like a stream of ghosts. Did he swing you into the forcefield? Motherfucker. That would put your lights out. 
Mark? Petr? Are you here?
How long has it been since the equinox?
