### Hour 08 - The Hold
On their way back the wind had stopped. They sighted the other party first, still dots in the wilderness five hundred meters off. Quickly they went dark but couldn’t tell if they had been sighted. The charge officer sent him out with scopes. The ground was covered in gentle moguls which he used to mask his approach. When he got into position he laid on his stomach and propped himself on his elbows and scanned the unknowns. Snow had found its way into his blankets and a groundshaking chill ran through him. He could barely stabilize the image.
The newcomers numbered nineteen in total. Husky and large in nonregulation furs and thickly studded surveyor’s pouches. Workers or tradesmen. A few carried scavenged watchmen’s pikes taller than a man with incandescent pyres still burning at their tips. Four of them smaller, younger, wearing familiar jumpsuits decked out with thermals. They sledded metal equipment boxes on a tarp between them. Fellow engineers, perhaps. All of them headed along the bearing of the homing beacon. Likely from *Nereid* given their gear.
Training his scopes in their direction of travel he saw the black structure in the middle of the field nearly a hundred meters long shaped like a maggot with a cornucopia maw at one end. At the maw it was several stories tall. Their common destination. They’d taken to calling it the hold: a dorsal cargo hold with a flat bottom. It had probably separated and touched down during troposphere entry, carving an icy ravine behind it.
He went back and told the charge officer. He hoisted an unconscious form and the party  set off doubletime.
Gassy walked up next to him, at the head of a stretcher. Her short spiky hair bare in the cold, goggles perched on her head like a mantis.

“Enjoy your shore leave back there?” she said.

he smiled as though filled anew with spirit. Then she stood and let out a long chattering breath. For an instant he beheld her silhouette in the ashen sky and thought of home.
---- 
They walked along a wake where flash-melted waves had re-frozen into skyward fingers almost as tall as the hold itself. The waves cast gnarled blue shadows in the shape of some ancient forest. Within the maw, a ruin of girders and jagged metal. Fountains of sparks like fireworks. Along their path a trail of cargo containers, shipping crates, netting, and machinery upended in the ice as though floating in a frozen sea. Footprints leading the way ahead, maybe a dozen or so tracks.
---- 
Two bearded crewmen looked down at them over the lip of the deck, among the pipes and conduits that jutted from an uneven coastline of mesh. They dropped ropes and she climbed first. Her blankets unraveled and flew about like a violent flame engulfing her body. At the top they dragged her up and over by the waist. Perhaps history’s least ceremonial ascendance into salvation. He went next, facing a nest of bulging mechanical guts as he climbed, legs crossed, fist over fist. His arms were weak; feeling all but gone in his digits. If she could make it so could he. After he fell panting onto the deck she came to him and they knelt together. 
It was all echoes and drafts in the hold. An icy wind blew from under the grate of the deck and sailed upwards all the way to the dark studded rails that formed supports like the interior of a vast rib cage.  The only light came from outside, leaving the aft of the deck dark, the middle a land of shadows. Barrels of blue flame burned with gel from the hold’s power relays. A good means of combustion but such a sin to burn in this manner. So many megajoules wasted. 
Twenty-strong survivors stood around them in a grove. Men and women, builders and engineers, huddled in blankets and jumpsuits. Faces hard as though engraved in stone. Even though they had only been marooned a brief time they looked like hell. Grey clothes and grey world alike.
---- 
They received steaming tin cups with ration cubes dissolved in water. He held his cup in both hands like a sacrament and sipped. Only a salty illusion of food so hot as to feel irradiated but it was all they had. She blew on hers with all her might to cool it down and drank eagerly. He’d given her all the blankets he could spare and they swaddled her until she looked like a pearshaped idol. But still she shivered, though she hid it well. He looked at her and she smiled back with eyes closed, teakettle spouts of steam from her nostrils.
They stood in line with about fifteen other survivors. At the head of the line the bearded noncom who had pulled them up was attending to a first-year boy with a mop of wet hair. Shining a penlight in the boy’s eyes and taking the boy’s pulse with his grimy fingers. The basics of field medicine. No hypothermia, he decreed. How far did you walk? Which division? The boy shook and dripped sweat and stammered. No matter how calmly the noncom spoke no answers came forth.
Finally as he watched the officer and the boy he spoke up. 
“Sir, I think he’s in shock.”
“You wait your turn!”
“Sir, you should just let him be!”
But the noncom ignored him and persisted in his line of questioning.
“Sir!”
The girl in front of them turned around. She was young, first- or second-year junior engineer, with close cropped acid-white hair. Under her blankets she had a metal harness and weathered straps like the kind dockworkers wore.
“You a medic or something?” she asked.
“More of a medic than he is.”
“Watch it. He’s your superior.”
“Age don’t make him superior.”
“How don’t it.”
“Don’t teach you to recognize shock, for one.”
She turned, her steps metallic, boots on deck. She squinted. Must have been the glare off the snow behind him. “You should respect the chain of command. You signed up same as everyone else.”
“I didn’t sign anything.”
“Then why are you here?”
“For my sister.”
“Who?”
“Hi,” she peeked out from behind him, hands cupped around her broth. 
“Oh.” The engineer softened her stance. As the line started to move she picked up her gear and shuffled ahead. It was heavy and metal in an elongated canvas rucksack with straps over the top and it made clanking noises like piping and valves when she slung it over her shoulder.
“You a flygirl?” he asked.
“I’m a runner.”
“Oh.”
“What’s that mean?”
“Nothing. Means ‘oh.’ ”
“You got something to say to me, medic?” 
“I’m not a medic.”
“Just like to talk big then.”
“I’m not a medic, but I know things. Same as I know you want to be a flygirl and not a runner.”
She let the rucksack fall and the crowd turned at the clamor.
“No shame in it,” he said.
“You just say that again.”
“I can tell by your eyes.”
She drew her fist back and telegraphed a right hook and he didn’t want to get bruised so he stepped into the arc of her swing and redirected her momentum and by the time they were done turning in a maelstrom of dark cloth he’d dropped his broth and her in the same motion. He knelt by her fallen form among her splayed blankets and picked up the empty cup and shook his head. The noncom was on his way over and the onlookers stood dazed.
Your eyes, he wanted to say. You got silvers put in. Only a pilot would need such a high-speed connection.
---- 
Alys told him to shut up in that gentle way of hers and sat with Gassy sharing her broth. He’d already told the noncom that he wouldn’t put Gassy on report and the noncom said for what and he said for attempted assault on a senior cadet. That didn’t smooth things over but he didn’t expect it to. The noncom said to get out of his sight and make himself useful and run a hardline up to the conn tower. He figured 

They arrived at the conn tower that shot upward like a thorn. He did his harness and Gassy did her own. They tethered themselves to the hull started their ascent. Alys stood watch at the base. 
He was barely ten meters up when the sun beamed through an opening of cloud and imparted a cold dying light on the hull around him. Orange, he thought, and the snow turning purple. More orange in the distance: burning wreckage from *Nereid* only now growing visible.
His sister’s voice came through his headset. “Can I have a callsign?”
“Why?”
“It’s bad luck not to have one.”
“Only if you’re in the service.”
“Maybe I’ll enlist.”
“When you’re old enough, I won’t stop you.”
“What’s your callsign?”
“I don’t have one.”
“It’s bad luck!”
“I don’t believe in luck.”
“I’m going to give you one.”
She went silent. He looked down at her despite himself, saw her spinning pirouettes in the snow, scarves trailing around her. Why wouldn’t she just stay inside? He kept climbing.
“Gassy,” she said. “*You* should be Gassy.”
---- 
The rest of them relayed their own similar accounts of the day. 
Everything electric went out at once. Interior structures turned to dead monoliths, studded with points of emergency lights. Anyone caught in an open-air section carried away as though by some divine hand. Almost none of the pods worked. Only those who found their way to some kind of auxiliary craft survived. 
The cause of  the downfall was yet unknown and also unknown was whether this cause presented imminent danger on the surface. The homing beacon had been a gamble and still was, but they had kept it going anyways. Incoming survivors brought only a trickle of information and it wasn’t nearly enough to piece together what happened. They could only sit around haggardly sifting through the wreckage while burning guts of the ship for heat.
Survival gear was plentiful, as were emergency blankets. *Nereid* had been well-equipped to fight the cold. There were prefabricated settlements intended for the first planetside colony. Open-air. Tropical units for equatorial settlement. They considered setting one up anyways but quickly determined that the structure would not have been sound in the ice or snow or the metal of the deck. But the parts were useful as scaffolding to erect dividers and screens, and a primitive set of windblocking corridors along the maw. 
---- 
A low-ranking crewman perched by the radio at the maw cupped his headset tightly to his ear. He shouted *contact!* and all twenty-odd faces rose to attention. More survivors.
Within the hour, they started to arrive by twos or threes. Builders and craftsmen. Support staff. Each covered with soot and then lacquered in sweat mixed with snow. A few with some standard implants, a hydraulic unit here, a terminal connection or welder’s flame there. Around fifteen men and women in total. Then came a detail of three medics followed by a squad of dragoons. They had tied cargo netting to their own watchmen’s pikes and bore at least ten wounded on them. Here and there an arm dangling overboard or a bloody stump. The color of their injuries darkening red to black. Covered in blankets and flags with the ship’s colors of blue and gold.
The dragoon charge officer approached the noncoms helmet in hand and warned of more incoming wounded from transports crashed along the northern and eastern ridges. Survivors of *Nereid* who weren’t so lucky. The noncoms gave two sets of orders. To the welders and heavy lifters they set the task of fashioning a series of ramps from the ground to the maw. To all the other able-bodied the task of rearranging the cargo units to form rows of beds.
