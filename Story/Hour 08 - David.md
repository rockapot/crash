## David
A howl of engine, then a rush of voices. The surface of the new world so routine underfoot just hours after planetfall. David allowed himself a single look back at the transport and squinted at its landing lights shining like a row of suns in the black sky. Artificial, like all light in space, like all light down here that night. A pounding tunnel of snow fell like stardust, mixed in with vapor from the jets. Of all the infinite promise and dimension of this new place how tragic it was to be confined to the remnants *Nereid.* What more was out there, if only they could cast a ray and fly?
The cargo hold was less than fifty meters ahead, its round mouth wide enough to swallow the transport ten times over. Inside were fires and torches and drapes of cloth put up as shields that bore shadowpuppet projections of the crew on their surface. 
Together with his companions he stretchered the boy across the field, where the wind and stinging powder assailed them. The boy’s face was a crushed and bloody bowl under a veil of concave fabric bleeding out the edges but still his chest rose and fell under the tarp that covered him.
Five or six field medics ran past them carrying bags and lines and kits, stepping lively through the compacted ice and debris.  They followed the medics close behind. He turned every so often to Gassy at his side, perhaps to make sure she hadn’t evaporated. Carl bore the other end of the stretcher in front. All three of them were in parkas so swollen that he could barely tell who was who. Fur rings at their hoods and breathing masks made strangers of them all. Around them the dragoons gathered in curved helmets and mouthpieces like beaks. He looked down at the boy and thought back to that morning and the evac.
---- 
After their shuttle rammed into the surface the snow and rock gutted the hull around them. Torn metal flew and ricocheted inside the cabin fast as the stars themselves, too fast to dodge. The four of them were strapped in and immobile. They landed upside down and three of them cut themselves out of their restraints and set about immediately trying to cut Rickon out of his as well. But his seat was crushed behind a cage of piping and they couldn’t get him loose, they worked and worked but couldn’t get him loose. They strapped lines to themselves and to the pipes and pulled like mules but the wreckage wouldn’t budge. All the while Rickon, the big guy from past the Dust Line, the homesteader’s kid who would still put his fatigues on backwards, he grinned through his bloody teeth, made calm like nothing was wrong. As the morning went on he started to turn purple. He said I know you tried and that’s all I could ask for but you got to go on. It’s survival first and friendship later. They told him to be quiet, that they were almost there. They tried new anchor points, making more complicated pulleys from the lines and cables, but during their machinations Rickon had passed on gently as stepping out of a room, leaving the three of them to dot the landscape on the journey to the hold. He didn’t even say anything before he left.
---- 
They walked the path of *Nereid*’s decay and found the hold in the dying light of the afternoon. A duty engineer saw Carl’s flight rating and sent them on a search-and-rescue in the single operational transport, a rusty stubnosed tub. There was a beacon on the northeastern ridge. They followed it and had picked up a boatload of survivors when they spotted the flare on the horizon. Carl reminded them that all the remaining fuel on the planet was in their tanks and they had barely enough to finish their run, let alone deviate. Gassy responded that the worst of the injured they had aboard were yellow cards and even if they did run out of fuel they’d make it within a few hundred feet, maybe a mile from the hold. The dozen or so crewmen they had rescued nodded groggily in agreement.
They flew after the flare and soon sighted the scout nosedown in the ice floes by the waterline. A large multidecked craft with a normal complement of a dozen, it had touched down outside the search grid for survivors, way outside the path that *Nereid* had struck on her descent. The scout transmitted no distress beacon, no comm traffic, nothing. It was dumb luck they saw its flare and an even dumber move to set down with only a pencil-thin searchbeam to guide them among the rocks. But the beach was long and flat and Carl found a landing site not too far away. 
Aboard the half-sunken scout it was Gassy who had swung her beacon around onto the boy, stepped across monstrous cantilevered arms of wreckage and found a pulse on his neck, stated in all calmness that he was still alive. Whatever hit him had taken out the orbits of his eyes and most of his cheekbones but left the brain underneath intact. He still drew breath from a pit where his nose had been. David kept his eyes on her as she spoke, fixed straight on her and nowhere else, editing the faceless horror from his mind. He radioed ahead to the triage team and told them about incoming. Before he got any reply the scout pitched and rolled and deck slanted into dark water. David and Carl got their tethers out in time and Gassy found a foothold with her back to the base of a secure worktable and cradled the boy against herself like some mutant child. Of the ensuing minutes David remembered little, only that he and Carl threw Gassy their lines, she wrapped them around the boy and they hauled him up and it wasn’t until Carl was bearing the boy out the scout’s airlock that she finally came up herself and and it was all he could do to yell *move! move!* until they emerged from the scout splashing water and crunching pebbles underfoot. 
Somehow the boy lived on. Everyone on the transport parted to let him lie on the floor, retreating up the bulkheads up to the portholes. Like he was a leper or a miracle, they couldn’t decide which. Those that could stand bandaged and in slings did so, grabbing the overhead lines and struts with their good arms. Gassy sat beside him on the deck and held him steady by the shoulders while the craft around them rose and pitched in turbulence. David rode in the back where he pumped the reserve tank to eke out every last ounce of fuel. Right when he thought it would rupture they sputtered to a landing and now.
---- 
They bore the boy up the switchbacked ramps into the hold, amid the drapes and crewmen alternately rushing or limping. The deck was slick and layered in mud. Blue fires burned left and right in storage barrels where a few crowds gathered around them like homeless. They were burning the conductive gel from the power grid. A good source of heat in a pinch but such a waste of megajoules.
A heavyset medic in a bloody apron with pigeonhole scopes over his eyes flanked them, peered under the cloth on the boy’s face while yelling from behind his mask.
What happened to this one?
We don’t know, David replied. We found him like this.
How long ago?
Around our last call. How long was that?
Where was he?
In a scout on the northeastern shore.
Where in the scout?
Just on the deck, the research lab. He was unconscious.
Stop it here.
Carl! Stop!
The medic inspected the crater of the boy’s face, the ridges of skin, then pulled his mask and scopes aside. Without his mask he was no older than David himself. Younger even, his hair and face equally red with freckles.
There’s nothing we can do for him, the medic replied curtly, and stepped past David.
Wait a minute. You barely looked at him. 
There’s nothing we can do.
He’s still alive! He’s still breathing. 
Gassy stepped in his path but the medic only stepped around her too.
Get back here and do your job! she yelled. You fucking disgrace! A few dirty faces looked to them like sunflowers. Mostly older men with beards the color of stone encroaching on their faces and metal limbs fanned before them. For what little time they had been shipwrecked they sure looked like hell. 
Easy, David said, as calm as he could.
The medic came back looking around and spoke calmly.
I got no time to waste on a suicide.
Suicide?
Plenty of people here fighting to stay alive. Me? I’m going to help them.
What do you mean suicide?
I did my rounds in the Harem district. Gun pressed against your temple, bang. Your aim is off, the muzzle points forward and takes off half your face. Seen it a dozen times.
You don’t know that, David said.
I do. Very well.
Why does it matter what happened to him?
The medic let out a deep breath, out of exhaustion, out of acquiescence perhaps. 
There’s nothing we can do for a wound like this. Set him down over there. Tell them he’s a black card.
But—
They’ll make him comfortable.
And the medic ran off to a squad of incoming dragoons bearing survivors wrapped in blankets, receiving each one of them and laying them down on the deck like mummified remains. The three engineers stood bewildered among the hearths and huddled forms, silently obstructing traffic.
---- 
Over there, David said. Carl led the way through the shouting crowd. Ahead of them some workmen from another squad of engineers ran with headlamps bobbing, carrying heavy metal sealers and power supplies. At their feet cables coiled and flowed across the deck. They ducked under a sudden pop of sparks  from some contraption of lights and cables and transferred the boy to a makeshift bed of boxes, the last entry in a row of casualties. There were no medics in sight.
Gassy pulled her hood down and set her goggles atop her forehead, cheeks flushed. A spotlight somewhere above made her short hair shine like honey. Carl sat on the floor with motions surprisingly quick for a man of his size. His hands went to his head like bearclaws and he pulled off his gear, then sat sweating with his lower lip in a pout.
Can you believe that asshole, Gassy said. Suicide.
David sighed. If it was, I don’t blame him.
How can you say that?
Poor guy lands, sees *Nereid* burn up in the sky. For all he knows, he’s the last man alive. All of his comms smashed, so he has no idea. Today it felt like you could walk a million miles down here without seeing anyone. At least we had each other. Imagine doing that walk alone. If I was him I’d consider…
He sighed again. Shook his head. 
Forget I said that.
Gassy sat beside Carl and leaned on him. But that makes no sense! Someone sent a flare up.
If no one secures a lander after touchdown the computer will send one up after a while.
When was the last time you saw a computer do what it was supposed to?
Gassy turned to Carl. He was sullen, too sullen to notice. Or perhaps deep in thought.
You okay? she asked him.
I don’t know, Carl said.
I’m sure more people made it, she replied. They’re still bringing them in all the time. You saw.
It’s not that.
What then?
His flight path was all wrong.
What?
To get to where he was, he would have had to fly perpendicular to *Nereid*’s orbital decay for quite some time.
So? He was trying to avoid the wake.
But it makes no sense to go that far. You wouldn’t fly out where nobody could find you. Especially if you had no comms and only flares.
Who knows what he was thinking? Maybe he really was trying to end it.
He was also pointed the wrong way. He was pointed *toward* our origin.
So he turned around to land?
His trench was to the north. He didn’t just turn around, he came down from the north facing south at *combat landing speeds.* That’s a hell of a strange flight path. Not to mention how he managed to fuel up a scout to make it that far while *Nereid* was going down.
Maybe he got lost, David said. Or he couldn’t clear the autopilot.
That’s not the most disturbing thing.
What do you mean?
Didn’t you guys notice?
Suddenly the boy coughed and spat and gurgled, then tented his back in spasm.
Holy shit.
David turned to Gassy.
Find someone.
He held the boy’s shoulder and told him easy and he was safe, but the boy started shouting in long unbroken streams. As though shouting for his life. It was incomprehensible. Among the rows of injured a few round eyes looked on timidly, their faces hidden behind cupped hands and dressings.
I think that’s Han, Carl said.
The boy tilted his head from side to side. He let fly blood and spittle, his voice surprisingly strong. Then he seemed to seize. Carl held down his other shoulder. The boy’s muscles were ropey and powerful. His neck bulged with cords and he went on cackling, squealing, like some shrill animal gifted with human speech but distinctly inhuman.
