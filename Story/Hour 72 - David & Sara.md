## David & Sara
### Hour 72
The sky was gone, and the ground, and the horizon. There was no visibility in the storm; all was white. Overhead, a mechanical wail trembled and intensified. It grew and grew until it dominated even the wind, then died on the ground with a muted thump and a plume of snow. Powder scattered in the wind and fell in a veil across the steaming craft: a wedge of gunmetal buried up to its cockpit glass. Inside were two survivors.
---- 
As the scalar field that protected them wore off he felt his weight return, heard his own breathing hot in his respirator. He sprung the latches of his harness and those breaths came heavy and rasping like muted screams. In, out. In, out. He pulled at the flight release; it didn’t work. All the electrics were down. Under the console he reached for the ejector switch and pulled, and the canopy above tore away, replaced by the shriek of the wind and the blind sky overhead.
He stood panting on his seat and turned around looking for the mechanical girl. She was behind him as when they had left, her helmet lolling forward gently above her ruined torso. She ended at the waist in flecks of distressed metal. Black craters at her arms and one shoulder gone to the rib cage. Not much skin left to speak of, just metal. Her spinal column was exposed and ran down the center of her back, severed a few inches below the rest of her, a blackened stump of armored coils. 
He climbed the pitch of the cabin and removed her oversized headgear and the wind took her dark hair horizontal before her face. Delicately he brushed it away with one hand, looked at the veneer of her features charred and cracking at the edges showing about them her metal jaw and bits of her teeth and eye socket. He would have brushed off the soot but he couldn’t tell whether he’d carry the skin away with it. She wore no respirator and grimaced. He nodded and she nodded back.
With a single motion he pulled off the bowl of his helmet and his respirator. The light hit him hard. Searing, frozen daylight that hung in the air like dew, drawing rainbow hexagons in his eyelashes. It was as though the sun had swollen white-hot and consumed the world, its photosphere churning in the air. He straddled the pilot’s chair still panting, feeling the chill run down his neck and under his flight jacket.
She gave him a smile, elated and graceless. So lifelike. She closed her eyes and threw her head back to the wind, and the flick of her motion brought the sting of immeasurable pity. About her and what she had once been. Her bright eyes, her cherub face. Underneath them the last murmur of the hopper’s intake jets became still. The latches of his harness dug into his chest and stomach. In the aftermath of adrenaline he grew cold, soaked in his own sweat, his hair dark and spiked with frost.
“How long have we got,” she shouted.
“We won’t last the day,” he replied. “I shouldn’t have blown the glass off.”
“Doesn’t matter. At least we made it.”
Did we? He came within a hair’s breadth of saying it but the smile on her blackened lips and the light in her eyes made her seem like she would live forever. Such happiness and freedom as he’d never known.
He uprooted his seat and produced from underneath a series of survival blankets and emergency flares. The flares were decayed and useless. He donned the blankets while shivering fiercely and tied them down with buckles and straps of frayed leather and metal. Even then, the wind wrenched them loose in places, unfurling them like nomad capes. When he wrapped a blanket around her she smiled and shook her head and mouthed a thank-you nonetheless.
Next he gathered supplies from a pouch by the gunner’s position, then a series of flasks, containers, and a disaster beacon. He checked the comm system, flicked every toggle on and off and back again, but the unit stayed dark. The electrics were still down and the batteries were probably smashed, inaccessible behind a ventral panel under sixteen tons of hopper. He felt for the flight recorder in the footwell but it was missing. There were no provisions, no weapons, no water. Combustion impossible: everything was fireproof save the dud flares.
After securing all he could, he carried her out and huddled with her under the lee of a fin and the warmth of a cooling engine blade. He planted her into the snow like a tree on its trunk and opened a bronze case with a faded caduceus to inspect its contents, pulling out each handheld unit and sparking it to life before replacing it. He tried to do the same with the hopper’s disaster beacon but its TRANSMIT indicator remained unlit. Even upon disassembling the unit, huddled carefully to not lose any screws, he could not trace the fault. In his failure he was glad that she fell asleep, her form limp, her head on his shoulder. She could sleep anywhere.
For half an hour they rested as the worst of the wind spun and eddied before them. He was filling the flasks with snow when the disaster beacon on his belt produced three sharp tones, level and calm. She woke. He flipped the unit over to the light of its CONTACT indicator.
“Someone out there?” she asked.
He turned on the beacon’s status display.
“Zero-one-zero. Homing beacon.”
“You’re kidding! Can you tell if they’re friendly?”
“No way to be sure.”
“How far?”
“It’s low power. Maybe five kliks range.”
She frowned and cracks opened in her forehead along the creases of the frown. The snow underneath them had molded perfectly to their forms. Finally she spoke.
“What are our chances?”
She looked at him and he didn’t look away. Her lips were taut, her brow furrowed. Even in the snow she was pale.
“You stay here,” he said. “I’ll take the tracker with me. I can find my way back to you if I need to.”
“No.”
“Sara—”
“No, David. Together.”
“I . . . I don’t know if I can protect you.”
“I’m no safer here than I am with you.”
He paused and considered this.
“We’ll find them,” she said. “We’ll find her. But it has to be together.”
“How do you know she’s even alive?”
She raised her noble chin to the wilderness. Her voice grew tinny and imperfect. “I’d know if she were dead. The world would burn and the stars would boil and our tongues would turn to ash.”
“Now you’re just on about nonsense.”
“Fine. Here’s something you can relate to. The universe is a closed system that affords no surprises. Conservation of mass. Entropy. People don’t just disappear.”
“Sure seems like they do.”
---- 
As they set off harnessed back-to-back he stopped for one last look at the hunkered form behind them. How like a perfect trapezoid it seemed, pointed and sleek like a scowling beast. She asked him what he was looking at.
“This is unfriendly territory. We ought to blow the hopper.”
“With what? No one’s here!”
He agreed, and they went on.
