## Survivors
### Hour 08
The wreckage of *Nereid* was strewn across the dark frozen wasteland, still burning in the night. Pieces of her were strewn across across the horizon in wells of orange and red flame, funnels of thick smoke lit by their own fires black against the black sky.
David lagged behind the search party. The wind blasted so hard that he staggered. His headgear beam lit snowflakes like the stars themselves and traced a frantic ellipsoid of ghostly white mist on the ground before him. He shifted the man he carried—or woman, it was hard to tell. A ragged form of awkward weights that tipped him eagerly this way and that. He had to stop and rest, catch his breath. A ponce move, but it was either that or drop his charge. He laid the form down gently as though unfurling it from himself, then knelt beside it and took a swig from his canteen.
He looked at the form swaddled in blankets like a pearshaped idol. A scarf on its head and face except for its eyes, which looked at him wide open. He pulled the scarf down to reveal smooth, round features. A young woman, barely more than a girl. She winced in his light and he turned it off.
“Welcome to the promised land,” he shouted over the wind.
She muttered something back that he couldn’t hear so he leaned in with his ear to her mouth and when she spoke again it was in Han.
“I don’t understand.”
She repeated it: a single word, two syllables, the last one a plaintive *oh* sound.
“What’s wrong? Are you in pain? Pain?”
She looked his canteen, then back at him.
“Water? Is that it?”
He gave her a swig and let her drink until it dribbled out of her mouth in a trail slimy down her chin. When he pulled the canteen away it was much lighter and the girl had closed her eyes once more. He upended the canteen and it was dry.
“You’ve got to be kidding me.”
He sighed and donned his gear and picked her up again.
The rest of the party had climbed a hill and were pulling away, losing opacity. He watched the last one crest the top and disappear over the other side. He traced their steps, certain he’d followed true, but when he looked beyond the peak he saw nothing; just an expanse. His thoughts muted. The breath of the world passed in a torrent. He wondered whether they had been real to begin with or if they were an illusion born purely from his need to not be alone. Calmly he switched off his beacon and scanned the landscape and despite the abundance of white static riding the wind he saw a movement of light near the bottom. He allowed himself to continue.
