## Crash
### Hour 00
The sky was gone, and the ground, and the horizon. There was no visibility in the storm; all was white. Overhead, a mechanical wail trembled and intensified. It grew and grew until it dominated even the gale, then died on the ground with a muted thump and a plume of snow. Powder scattered in the wind and fell in a veil across the steaming craft: a wedge of gunmetal buried up to its cockpit glass. Inside were two survivors.
---- 
As the scalar field that protected them wore off he felt his weight return, heard his own breathing hot in his respirator. He sprung the latches of his harness and those breaths came heavy and rasping like muted screams. In, out. In, out. He pulled at the flight release; it didn’t work. All the electrics were down. Under the console he reached for the ejector switch and pulled, and the canopy above tore away, replaced by the shriek of the wind and the blind sky overhead.
He stood panting on his seat and turned around, looking for her. She was behind him as when they left, her helmet lolling forward gently. He was about to climb the pitch of the cabin and rouse her but before he could do so she removed her oversized headgear. When she pulled it off the wind took her light hair horizontal before her face. Delicately she brushed it away with one hand, and with the other she undid her harness. She wore no respirator and grimaced. He nodded and she nodded back.
With a single motion he pulled off the bowl of his helmet and his respirator. The light hit him hard. Searing, frozen daylight that hung in the air like dew, drawing rainbow hexagons in his eyelashes. It was as though the sun had swollen white-hot and consumed the world, its photosphere churning in the air. He straddled the pilot’s chair still panting, feeling the chill run down his neck and under his flight jacket.
They shared a look and she gave him a smile, elated and graceless. As though drawing a conspiracy around them. She closed her eyes and threw her head back to the wind, and the flick of her motion brought the sudden realization that such human qualities were insignificant in the infinite plane around them. Her smoky eyes, her cherub face. She reached for the crook of his elbow and pulled his arm gently and took his hand in her own. Underneath them the last murmur of the hopper’s intake jets became still. The latches of his harness dug into his chest and stomach. In the aftermath of adrenaline he grew cold, soaked in his own sweat, his hair spiked with frost.
“How long you think we got,” he shouted.
“We won’t last the day,” she replied.
“I shouldn’t have blown the glass off.”
“Doesn’t matter. At least we made it.”
“Did we?”
They uprooted the seating and produced from pitted tackleboxes a series of survival blankets and emergency flares. The flares were decayed and useless. They donned the blankets while shivering fiercely and tied them down with buckles and straps of frayed leather and metal. Even then, the wind wrenched them loose in places, unfurling them like nomad capes. She gathered supplies from a pouch by the gunner’s position, then a series of flasks, containers, and a disaster beacon. He checked the comm system, flicked every toggle on and off and back again, but the unit stayed dark. The electrics were still down and the batteries were probably smashed, inaccessible behind a ventral panel under sixteen tons of hopper. He felt for the flight recorder in the footwell but it was missing. There were no provisions, no weapons, no water. And no combustion: everything was fireproof save the dud flares.
Nevertheless they climbed out and huddled under the lee of a fin and the warmth of a cooling engine blade. He watched her open a bronze case with a faded caduceus and inspect its contents, pulling out each handheld unit and sparking it to life before replacing it. He tried to do the same with the hopper’s disaster beacon but its TRANSMIT indicator remained unlit. Even upon disassembling the unit, huddled carefully to not lose any screws, he could not trace the fault. In his failure he was glad that she seemed to have fallen asleep, her hand on his bicep and her head on his shoulder. She could sleep anywhere.
They rested for half an hour as the worst of the wind spun and eddied before them. He was filling the flasks with snow when the disaster beacon on his belt produced three sharp tones, level and calm. She woke. He flipped the unit over to the light of its CONTACT indicator.
“Someone found us?” she asked.
“We’re not transmitting. We found someone else.”
“Out here? On the surface?”
He turned on the beacon’s status display.
“One of ours?” she asked.
“Zero-one-zero. Homing beacon.”
“You’re kidding!”
“Says right here.”
“How far?”
“Low power signal. Maybe five kliks range.”
She frowned and her forehead creased. The snow underneath them had molded perfectly to their forms. Finally she spoke.
“Can you tell if anyone’s alive?”
“It’s not an automated signal. But no. No way to be sure.”
“What are our chances?”
She looked at him and he didn’t look away. Her lips were taut, her brow furrowed. Even in the snow she was pale. She held the bronze case to her chest like a schoolgirl.
“I could do it alone,” he said.
“No. You promised you wouldn’t leave me.”
“Alys—”
“You goddamn promised!”
And then she put her arm on his and spoke gently.
“I promised you too.”
As they set off with the wind and snow at their backs, he stopped for one last look at the hunkered form behind them. How like a perfect trapezoid it seemed, pointed and sleek like a scowling beast. She asked him what he was looking at.
“This is unfriendly territory. We ought to blow the hopper.”
“With what? No one’s here!”
He agreed, and they went on.
