### Hour 04
Over sixty survivors. Half of them able-bodied.
He dangled inverted on an overhead line with six other juniors hotwiring the cylindrical atmosphere pumps big as moons in the sky. The deck was a dizzy blur, a pastiche of bloody strokes dark and angry around the makeshift triage ward. Blood on the blankets and blood on the curtains and blood seeping through the sheets of the writhing injured. Medics calling nonsense to each other, blood on them too. Don’t think about that. And don’t look down. Look outside if you have to. It’s the same right side up as upside down. 
After twenty-five minutes of work all the pumps hummed in chorus and blasted air downward to the deck. In a brief celebration they hooted and cheered.
“They online?” came her voice over the headset, yelling hard over the wind.
“They’re on the grid. Come on in, you earned your keep.”
“Roger.”
The juniors set themselves down and climbed out of their harnesses. Once out they were nothing more than a lot of skinny kids, he thought. Well, most of them. The fat one was with them and he had to set himself down on the deck to undo his gear. The grizzled builders gave them funny looks and thanked them for the heat and went on stacking crates for the medics. 
One of the noncom engineers gathered all their gear and counted it up, then called him over along with the lanky junior.
“You’re short one set of tethers and one lancer.”
“Someone forgot to check in sir?”
“You tell me.”
“Who had a lancer?” he asked the other junior.
“Wasn’t that your sister? She was running the line outside.”
He opened the line on his headset. “Five-six Five-six. Front and center.”
“Five-six, you respond.”
“Alys, where the hell are you?”
“Alys?”
---- 
She’s alive, he reminded himself. He’d know if she were dead. The world would burn and the stars would boil and their tongues would turn to lead. The universe was a closed system that afforded no surprises. Conservation of mass. Entropy. An orderly descent into disorder. A girl doesn’t just disappear.
It was almost dark already. He faced the onslaught of snow like sand and in the machinists’ goggles a blur of distant firestorms clouded the air. Above him a running light blinked dumbly as though it were still attached to a ship. He clunked along the metal behemoth. This was the third time he had circumnavigated the hold and it was getting harder to make his way round the sides and back. Since he went out to look for her the storm had resumed and the snowline had pushed its way up the side of the hull by another meter or so.
Where the fuck are you?
---- 
He found her atop the hold by the spire overlooking the edge of its maw. Sitting on its globe-like hull. Her gaze focused deep into the black world and the flames on its horizon. She’d kept her goggles on but her mask hung around her throat by its straps. He approached her from behind. Running lights burst to life around them.
“Alys.”
“David.”
“Are you goddamn nuts?”
“I saw it again, David.”
“What?”
“Out here. It became the sky.”
“Come inside! What is wrong with you?”
“You know what. It’s here. It followed us here.”
“Oh god.”
“There’s nowhere left for us to run.”
He squeezed his eyes shut tight as they would go.
“Alys—”
“Good and merciful mother. When the moon fell in love with a star.”
“Leave it alone! We’re here.”
“Do you know why God made space?”
“Stop it, Alys.”
He sat down beside her.
“We are not meant to be here.”
“Yes we are. We made it. Not exactly how we planned but we made it, we’re alive, you and me. This is our new home.”
“But it’s wrong. It’s wrong.”
He lit a Seven Star from the pack in his flight jacket. Maybe the last pack on the whole planet. He took a drag then passed it to her. She accepted it but it went out before she brought it to her lips.
“Do you know how goddamned lucky we are,” he said.
She turned to him cigarette dead in her mouth.
“Lucky,” she replied.
“Yes, lucky! Not only did we make it aboard while they were closing the fucking ramps, but we flew a thousand-year-old ship across a dozen light-years without any major event en route, and—*and* we survived whatever the hell happened up there!”
“But I *saw* it.”
He sighed and lit her cigarette.
“I’m not crazy.” She took a drag from it and held it trembling. “Even after all these years you don’t believe me.”
“All right. But whatever you saw is back in the city. Back on Monument. There’s no way it could make it out here.”
“It came with us. It brought us down and now it’ll have us.”
“No. No, we’re safe. We made it.”
“Do you know why God made space?”
“Are you even listening?”
“Do you?”
“Hubris of man. What’s that got to do with anything?”
“No. For our protection. He laid the infinities between the stars but it wasn’t enough.”
She looked to the precipice before them.
“It wasn’t enough.”
“Don’t do it,” he said. “You promised.”
 In the space of several blinks she stared back and forth as though considering possibilities, then tossed the cigarette into the void. The goggles turned her eyes into two big portholes of reflected flame. He checked and double-checked her harness and together they retreated down the service rungs. Before them passed a single gargantuan letter of the ship’s markings, paint and rust caked on the deck from the centuries. Underneath the fog roiled and churned and gave the illusion that there was no ground at all.
