### Hour 04
The cargo hold was a hundred-meter-long section of *Nereid*’s superstructure shaped like a maggot with a cornucopia maw at one end several stories tall. It appeared to have separated and touched down during troposphere entry, carving an icy ravine behind it. They walked along its wake where flash-melted waves had re-frozen into skyward fingers almost as tall as the hold itself. It cast a long blue shadow in the shape of some gnarled ancient forest. Within the maw, a ruined mass of girders and jagged metal. Fountains of sparks like fireworks. Along its path a trail of cargo containers, shipping crates, netting, and machinery upended in the ice as though floating in a frozen sea.

Two bearded engineers appeared over the lip of the ruined deck, among the lines and conduits that jutted from an uneven coast of mesh. They dropped ropes and she climbed first. Her blankets unraveled and flew about like a violent flame engulfing her body. At the top they dragged her up and over by the waist. Perhaps history’s least ceremonial ascendance into salvation. He went next, facing a nest of bulging mechanical guts as he climbed legs crossed, fist over fist. Feeling all but gone from his digits. After he made it panting over the lip of the deck he knelt with her. Twenty-strong survivors stood around them and gave a brief standing ovation. Men and women, workers and engineers. Even though they had only been marooned a brief time they looked like hell.
---- 
Soon they learned that those same engineers had found the cargo hold early in Nor’s daycycle and hotwired a personal transmitter to its spire for continuous broadcast. Being the seniormost noncommissioned officers they also took duty and directed the salvage operations of the day.
Survival gear was plentiful, as were emergency blankets. *Nereid* had been well-equipped to fight the cold. Donning this gear the crew had hauled out the worst of the wreckage. There was some prefabricated housing intended for planetside residence left intact in the rear. They considered setting a unit up but quickly determined that the structure would not have been sound in the ice or snow or the metal of the deck. But the parts were useful as scaffolding to set up dividers and screens, and a primitive set of windblocking corridors along the maw. The gel in the hold’s power relays was an economic means of combustion and they set about arranging barrels of blue flame and metal crates to stave off the elements. It was sinful to burn it in this manner, he thought. So many megajoules wasted.
---- 
They took inventory with the four apprentice engineers and traded stories. Speculating about the ship’s demise. He started to tell their tale but she told it better.
Everything went dark like a breaker tripped.  There were only handheld lights and chemical overheads. Corridors spun and spun in microgravity. The air was thick like soup. The pumps. You couldn’t hear the pumps. Complete silence for the first time in four years. It was maddening. They climbed for what felt like miles and miles. Found a working hopper and got in together.
A skinny junior named Sam took over. He had escaped with Carl, the fat friend beside him. Hours earlier he awoke upside-down suspended ten meters in the air, adrift in a cloud of smoke and jet fuel. Strapped to a dead hopper whose fuselage had torn away around them. The high drone of the engines slowly faded in. (Not the engines, Carl told him, but the coolant pumps, trying to siphon heat away from the sensitive fuel lines.) His neck was sore and his jumpsuit was soaked with urine.
Happens to everyone, said Carl. The human body can take hundreds of g in a hard slap to the face with no lasting damage. But a constant sixteen g for a minute can kill you. During an extreme deceleration such as the uncontrolled braking of a hopper’s emergency thrusters, you could go eyeballs-out 100 g for a few moments, even under the protection of a scalar field. This would keep you from impacting on the surface at near the speed of sound. Once when he was fifteen there was a shuttle making a run from one orbital to another and its nav system went haywire sending the crew on a trajectory beyond tolerance. The shuttle had arrived with sixteen corpses strapped into flight seats like business as usual. But on closer inspection their noses were bleeding and their bowels were empty. No, Carl remembered, not sixteen corpses. Fifteen had died and the last one suffered catastrophic brain damage. That last one just sat around and occasionally made a monotonous honking noise along with his ventilator. They had been lucky. Loss of consciousness but no serious O2 deprivation. No lasting effects as far as they could tell.
The duty engineers discouraged speculation among the juniors and set them back to work.
---- 
During a smoke break by the maw he pulled her aside and they gazed out at the stark white now turning slowly to grey.
“You believe this horseshit?”
She accepted the burning cigarette but it went out by the time she brought it to her lips. She shook her head. “Such is fate.”
“Don’t tell me you’d cast your lot with them.”
“You should believe in something other than yourself for a change.”
“When I find something worthwhile.”
“Don’t you realize what’s happening?”
She sheltered the cigarette with one hand as she brought it back to life. He leaned on a precarious railing. A metallic groan arose from all around.
“Something’s after us,” she said. “Our time is short.”
“No—”
“The Eater of Worlds.”
“Don’t start. Not here.”
She tossed the cigarette into the white void and retreated into the hold.
“Demon Moon and Mother Star,” he muttered. “Protect us.”
