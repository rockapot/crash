### Hour 04
The source of the signal: a cargo hold. A hundred-meter-long section of *Nereid*’s superstructure shaped like a maggot with a cornucopia maw at one end several stories tall. It appeared to have separated and touched down during troposphere entry, carving an icy ravine behind it. The rest of the ship was nowhere in sight.
They walked along the wake where flash-melted waves had re-frozen into skyward fingers almost as tall as the hold itself. The waves cast gnarled blue shadows in the shape of some ancient forest. Within the maw, a ruin of girders and jagged metal. Fountains of sparks like fireworks. Along their path a trail of cargo containers, shipping crates, netting, and machinery upended in the ice as though floating in a frozen sea. Footprints leading the way ahead.

Two bearded crewmen looked down at them over the lip of the deck, from among the pipes and conduits that jutted from an uneven coastline of mesh. They dropped ropes and she climbed first. Her blankets unraveled and flew about like a violent flame engulfing her body. At the top they dragged her up and over by the waist. Perhaps history’s least ceremonial ascendance into salvation. He went next, facing a nest of bulging mechanical guts as he climbed, legs crossed, fist over fist. His arms weak; feeling all but gone from his digits. If she could make it so could he. After he fell panting onto the deck she came to him and they knelt together. Twenty-strong survivors stood around them in a grove. One of the bearded men knelt with them, saying brother, sister, you found us. 
They were men and women, workers and engineers. Their faces hard as though engraved in stone. Even though they had only been marooned a brief time they looked like hell.
---- 
Soon they learned that two engineers had found the hold early in Nor’s daycycle and hotwired a personal transmitter to its spire for continuous broadcast. Being the seniormost noncommissioned officers they also took duty and directed salvage operations.
Survival gear was plentiful, as were emergency blankets. *Nereid* had been well-equipped to fight the cold. Donning this gear the engineers hauled out the worst of the wreckage. There were prefabricated settlements intended for planetside use intact in the rear. They considered setting a unit up but quickly determined that the structure would not have been sound in the ice or snow or the metal of the deck. But the parts were useful as scaffolding to erect dividers and screens, and a primitive set of windblocking corridors along the maw. The gel in the hold’s power relays provided an emergency means of combustion and they set about arranging barrels of blue flame and metal crates to stave off the elements. It was sinful to burn it in this manner, he thought. So many megajoules wasted.
---- 
He hauled inventory with her and two junior engineers named Sam and Carl. Sam was small and slightly-mustached and had the hardened look of a central Mother-city kid. Carl was the opposite: fat and uncouth, prone to sweats and stammering. But it was Carl who inquired nervously if they knew anything about what happened to *Nereid*. He started to tell their story but she told it better.
“Everything went dark like a breaker tripped. There were only handheld lights and chemical overheads. Corridors spun and spun in microgravity. The air was thick like soup. The pumps. You couldn’t hear the atmosphere pumps. Complete silence for the first time in four years. It was maddening. We climbed for what felt like miles and miles. Found a working hopper and got in together.”
Sam took over as though in a trance. “Every light in the atrium went out at once. The world overhead turned to dead monoliths hanging in open air, studded with points of emergency lights like campfires.”
“Anyone caught out in that atrium when we lost our pull would fly off hundreds of meters and get slammed into a bulkhead.”
“Unless they had their wits about them and attached their lines.”
“Only a few servicemen wear lines. I’d like to see anyone try to latch one on in a panic.”
During a smoke break by the maw he pulled her aside and they gazed out at the stark world that was turning slowly to grey.
“You believe that horseshit?” he asked.
She accepted the burning cigarette but it went out by the time she brought it to her lips. She shook her head. 
“Such is fate,” she replied. “You should believe in something other than yourself for a change.”
“When I find something worthwhile.”
“Don’t you realize what’s happening?”
She sheltered the cigarette with one hand and brought it back to life. He leaned on a precarious railing. A metallic groan arose from all around.
“Something’s after us,” she said. “Our time is short.”
“No—”
“The Curse of the Silence. The Eater of Worlds.”
“We’ve come this far. Don’t start. Not here.”
She tossed the cigarette into the void outside and retreated into the hold.
“Eater of Worlds,” he muttered. “Demon Moon and Mother Star.”
