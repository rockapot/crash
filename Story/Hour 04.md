### Hour 04
The cargo hold was a hundred-meter-long section of *Nereid*’s superstructure shaped like a maggot with a cornucopia maw at one end several stories tall. It appeared to have separated and touched down during troposphere entry, carving an icy ravine behind it. They walked along its wake where flash-melted waves had re-frozen into skyward fingers almost as tall as the hold itself. It cast a long blue shadow in the shape of some gnarled ancient forest. Within the maw, a ruined mass of girders and jagged metal. Fountains of sparks like fireworks. Along its path a trail of cargo containers, shipping crates, netting, and machinery upended in the ice as though floating in a frozen sea.
---- 
Two bearded engineers appeared over the lip of the ruined deck, among the lines and conduits that jutted from an uneven coast of mesh. They dropped ropes and she climbed first. Her blankets unraveled and flew about like a violent flame engulfing her body. At the top they dragged her up and over by the waist. Perhaps history’s least ceremonial ascendance into salvation. He went next, facing a nest of bulging mechanical guts as he climbed legs crossed, fist over fist. Feeling all but gone from his digits. After he made it panting over the lip of the deck he knelt with her. Twenty-strong survivors stood around them and addressed him as a brother, her as a sister. Men and women, workers and engineers. Their faces hard as though engraved in stone. Even though they had only been marooned a brief time they looked like hell.
---- 
Soon they learned that those same engineers had found the cargo hold early in Nor’s daycycle and hotwired a personal transmitter to its spire for continuous broadcast. Being the seniormost noncommissioned officers they also took duty and directed the salvage operations of the day.
Survival gear was plentiful, as were emergency blankets. *Nereid* had been well-equipped to fight the cold. Donning this gear the crew had hauled out the worst of the wreckage. There was some prefabricated housing intended for planetside settlements left intact in the rear. They considered setting a unit up but quickly determined that the structure would not have been sound in the ice or snow or the metal of the deck. But the parts were useful as scaffolding to set up dividers and screens, and a primitive set of windblocking corridors along the maw. The gel in the hold’s power relays was an economic means of combustion and they set about arranging barrels of blue flame and metal crates to stave off the elements. It was sinful to burn it in this manner, he thought. So many megajoules wasted.
---- 
They hauled inventory with the four apprentice engineers who inquired meekly if they knew anything about what happened to *Nereid*. They did not. He started to tell their story but she told it better.
Everything went dark like a breaker tripped. There were only handheld lights and chemical overheads. Corridors spun and spun in microgravity. The air was thick like soup. The pumps. You couldn’t hear the pumps. Complete silence for the first time in four years. It was maddening. They climbed for what felt like miles and miles. Found a working hopper and got in together.
The others echoed with similar tales of escape. Finally the discourse took a turn into speculation. 
Weeks in a parking orbit without an order to disembark. Ten thousand of Monument’s finest sitting on the brink of the promised land in a holding pattern. The latest bulletins saying quarantine was still in effect. But no scans of the planet, no incoming telemetry. Were they even still sending probes? Something was wrong.
The duty engineers discouraged speculation among the juniors and set them back to work.
---- 
During a smoke break by the maw he pulled her aside and they gazed out at the stark white now turning slowly to grey.
“You believe this horseshit?”
She accepted the burning cigarette but it went out by the time she brought it to her lips. She shook her head. “Such is fate.”
“Don’t tell me you’d cast your lot with them.”
“You should believe in something other than yourself for a change.”
“When I find something worthwhile.”
“Don’t you realize what’s happening?”
She sheltered the cigarette with one hand as she brought it back to life. He leaned on a precarious railing. A metallic groan arose from all around.
“Something’s after us,” she said. “Our time is short.”
“No—”
“The Eater of Worlds.”
“Don’t start. Not here.”
She tossed the cigarette into the white void and retreated into the hold.
“Demon Moon and Mother Star,” he muttered. “Protect us.”
