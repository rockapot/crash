### Hour 05
The juniors set about reviving the hold’s atmosphere pumps to deliver heat. He dangled upside-down on an overhead line with four others, jumpstarting the cylindrical units big as moons in the sky. Wind turned their blankets into sails. The deck so far away that the mesh became a dizzy blur. Don’t look down. Look outside if you have to, it’s the same right side up as upside down. After forty-five minutes all the pumps hummed in chorus and blasted air downward to the deck. In a brief celebration they hooted into their headsets.
“They online?” came her voice yelling hard over the wind.
“They’re on the grid. Come on in, you earned your pay.”
“Roger.”
They set themselves down and climbed out of their harnesses. Once out they were nothing more than a lot of skinny kids. The grizzled builders gave them funny looks and thanked them for the heat and went on stacking crates along the entrance. 
One of the noncomm engineers gathered all their gear and counted it up, then called him over along with another junior.
“You’re short one set of tethers and one lancer.”
“Someone forgot to check in sir?”
“You tell me.”
“Who had a lancer?” he asked the other junior.
“Five-six. She was running the line outside.”
He opened the line on his headset. “Five-six Five-six. Front and center.”
“Five-six, you respond.”
“Alys, where the hell are you?”
“Alys?”

He found her by a contower by the maw gazing out at the stark greying world. He’d seen that look before, back in the Mother-city and the Scrapyards and finally the launchpad at Oth.  A mixture of hope and contemplation of suicide.
“They would have been happy for us,” he said.
She accepted the burning cigarette but it went out by the time she brought it to her lips. She shook her head. 
“Such is fate,” she replied.
“I like to think it didn’t turn out so bad.”
“No, it didn’t.”
She sheltered the cigarette with one hand and brought it back to life. He leaned on a precarious railing.
“In fact,” she said, “it turned out as good as I could have hoped.”
“”
“We’ll never escape. All we can do is bide our time and live well.”
She tossed the cigarette into the void outside and retreated into the hold.
