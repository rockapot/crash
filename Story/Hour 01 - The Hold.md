Distance was meaningless here, except the distance between her and himself. As they climbed a hill she started to pull away, lose opacity. She crested the top and was gone over the other side.

He wondered whether she had been real to begin with or if she was an illusion born purely from his need to not be alone. Calmly he scanned the landscape and the abundance of white static riding the wind and he saw her near the bottom. He allowed himself to continue.
