## The Hold
### Hour 01
The wind blasted so hard that they staggered in their steps. Every now and again she would fall elbow-deep in the snow and he’d pick her up. When he stumbled she did the same.
Distance was meaningless here, except the distance between them. As they climbed a hill she started to pull away, to lose opacity. She crested the top and was gone over the other side. He traced her steps, certain he’d followed true, but when he looked beyond the peak he saw nothing; just an expanse. His thoughts muted. The breath of the world passed in a torrent. He wondered whether she had been real to begin with or if she was an illusion born purely from his need to not be alone. Calmly he scanned the landscape and despite the abundance of white static riding the wind he saw her near the bottom. He allowed himself to continue.
