He dangled upside-down on an overhead line with four others, jumpstarting the cylindrical units big as moons. After forty-five minutes of the dizzying height all the pumps hummed simultaneously and blasted air downward to the deck. In a brief celebration they hooted into their headsets.
“Crushed it.”
“They online?” came her yelling hard over the wind.

They set themselves down and climbed out of their harnesses. Once out they were nothing more than a lot of skinny kids. The grizzled builders gave them funny looks and thanked them for the heat but went on anyways stacking crates along the entrance. One of the noncomm engineers gathered all their gear and counted it up, then called him over along with another junior.
“You’re short one set of tethers and one lancer.”
“Someone forgot to check in sir?”
“You tell me.”
“Who’d have a lancer?” he asked the other junior.
