## Hour 08 - Bodies
---- 
How’s our boy? Gassy asked.
Still asleep.
What are you doing?

The skies are empty.
For tonight, yes. No more fuel.
Is it just us three then?
I suppose.
No, I mean, are we it.
We don’t know that, Carl replied. You said it yourself. They’re still bringing new people in all the time. On foot, if they have to.
She nodded and went back to contemplating the night.
We tried, David said. We tried. We did all we could.
But…
I know.
It’s just so goddamn…
I know. But we tried.
What do we do now?
Keep going, I guess.
Why?
What do you mean, why?
David lit a Silver from the pack in his jumpsuit. Maybe the only pack on the whole planet. He took a drag then passed it to her. She accepted it but it went out before she brought it to her lips.
We’re pretty lucky, you know, Carl said.
She turned to him cigarette dead in her mouth.
Lucky.
At least those aren’t plasma fires, or we’d be irradiated by now.
Yeah. We’re all shades of lucky.
Well, come on, David said. How did you think it would end? It’s a miracle we made it this far. Do you know how often I lay in my bunk and heard the engines cycle just a little too long and I thought, this is it. This is where we stop. Where the stars take our bones. But no, every time we kept going. We went on.
I thought we’d never launch, Carl replied. I thought we’d all bought it when the ship hit the city. Or even earlier—
Okay, Gassy said. Okay. Lucky. I get it. I just wish— She caught herself a moment. I wish someone else had survived. Other than me.
How so?
Fat lot of good I am. No ship left to fix. All our technology, down in the drink somewhere. She re-lit the cigarette and dragged. Useless.
No, David said.
No?
We’re not useless. We’re exactly as useful as we think we are.
She didn’t even turn to look at him.
What if we refuel that transport and fly it down to *Nereid*? Like a deep-sea salvage.
That’s going to be tough cause it’s missing windows, Carl replied.
That spacecraft is missing windows?
Didn’t you notice?
Fine. There’s something else we can do.
Like what? Gassy passed the cigarette back and pulled her hood back. Our Leviathan is no longer a creature of the sky. We’re flotsam. Obsolete in the new world.
Another party of dragoons marched up the hold’s frozen wake, the glow of their pikes coming slowly into view. Their shadows formed as they stepped into the light and snaked behind them over the pits and sinews of ice.
The orbitals, Carl said. They’re still up there, right?
Last I checked. Why? What are you thinking?
If we could link up with them, we could at least use their imagers to scan the surface.
