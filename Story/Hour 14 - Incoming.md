### Hour 14
A fine mist of blood covered Mica’s scopes and face. It was everywhere, dripping across her forehead and into her sputtering mouth. She turned frantically between Em and her patient.
“Em, help me close!”
Em grabbed the protoplaser with both hands and hefted it across the deck. A spotlight swung overhead and dragoons ran forth among the medics. 
Mica was wrist-deep in a gash on the inner thigh of a young Han boy, maybe fifteen years old. He was well-built but thin, stripped down to his skivvies. Mica was trying to clamp his femoral but she’d never done the procedure before or even practiced in simulation. The prospect of doing such a thing manually was all but unthinkable until now.
Em clunked the plaser down in the vee of the boy’s legs and started to focus.
“Clamp it.” 
Blood continued to well.
“Harder!”
“I know!” Mica yelled back.
“I mean it!”
Finally she could see the rupture and brought down the plaser's arm to bear. She checked the device’s reserve. Barely a quarter capsule of bio gel. She pulled her own scopes down from her forehead, then leaned in close over the boy’s other leg, guiding the arm with both hands.
“Locked. Burning!”
She fired and the air filled with a rude buzz and a white-hot light. They both squinted behind her scopes, Mica having the luxury of looking away. Em’s hair fell in front of her face and she felt dangerously close to singeing it off.
“Looks good. I’ve got a seal and it’s holding. I’m going to extend. Clear.”
“Do it!” Mica removed her hands and Em started guiding the plaser millimeter by painstaking millimeter, reaching beyond the arc with her own hands to guide the deep tissue mend. The scent of cauterized flesh filled the air, acrid, chemical. Her fingers grew hot through her calluses in proximity to the needle-sharp beam but she endured. After an agonizing minute her hands and wrists cramped and she felt she would go blind even from behind the protection of her scopes. Finally the repair reached its end and she cut the plaser, certain she wouldn’t have been able to endure another second of it.
Mica had already loaded an epidermal unit. It took thirty staples to close and the resulting scar was jagged and horrific. The boy was pale and sweaty, his pulse racing and blood pressure low.
“Check the donor pool. He’s going to need . . . Mica, are you listening?”
“You’re bleeding.” Mica pointed to her nose, and Em brought her aching finger to her face and pulled it away bloody. Dark graceful splotches ran down the front of her fatigues. She felt lightheaded. Spry Mica was already at her side, guiding her gently to the deck. The toothy mesh dug into her ungloved hand. She chided herself for forgetting her gloves.
“How many reds did you take?” Mica asked, handing Em some gauze.
“Two or three. Per hour.”
“God, how are you not in arrest?”
“I come from a long line of addicts.”
“Not funny, miss.”
“I’m fine.”
“At least stay down until your system is clear.”
“Can’t order me. You’re . . . underclassman.”
“No, but I can blackmail you.”
