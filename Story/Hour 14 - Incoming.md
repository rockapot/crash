### Hour 14
A fine mist of blood covered Mica’s scopes and face. It was everywhere, dripping across her forehead and into her sputtering mouth. She turned frantically between Em and her patient. She was wrist-deep in a gash on the inner thigh of a young Han boy, maybe fifteen years old, trying to clamp his femoral. He was well-built but thin, stripped down to his skivvies.
“Em, help me close!”
Em grabbed the protoplaser with both hands and hefted it across the deck. A blessed, working protoplaser scavenged with the last round of survivors.
She clunked the plaser down in the vee of the boy’s legs and started to focus. A spotlight swung briefly overhead before leaving the deck in the waxy yellow glow of lanterns and mirrors.
“Clamp it.” 
Blood continued to well.
“Harder!”
“I know!” Mica yelled back.
“I mean it!”
Finally she could see the rupture and brought down the plaser's arm to bear. She checked the device’s reserve. Barely a quarter capsule of biogel. She pulled her own scopes down from her forehead, then leaned in close over the boy’s other leg, guiding the arm with both hands.
“Locked. Burning!”
She fired and the air filled with a rude buzz and a white-hot light. They both squinted behind their scopes, Mica having the luxury of looking away. Em’s hair fell in front of her face and she felt dangerously close to singeing it off.
“Looks good. I’ve got a seal and it’s holding. I’m going to extend. Clear.”
“Do it!” Mica removed her hands and Em started tracking the plaser millimeter by painstaking millimeter, reaching beyond the arc with her own hands to guide the deep tissue mend. The scent of cauterized flesh filled the air, acrid, chemical. Her fingers grew hot through her calluses in proximity to the needle-sharp beam but she endured. After an agonizing minute her hands and wrists cramped and she felt she would go blind even from behind the protection of her scopes. Finally the repair reached its end and she cut the plaser, certain she wouldn’t have been able to endure another second of it.
Mica had already loaded an epidermal unit. It took thirty staples to close and the resulting scar was jagged, almost sawtoothed. The boy was pale and sweaty, his pulse racing and blood pressure low.
“Check the donor pool. He’s going to need . . . Mica, are you listening?”
“You’re bleeding. Your nose.” Em brought her aching finger to her face and pulled it away bloody. Dark graceful splotches ran down the front of her fatigues. She felt lightheaded. Spry Mica was already at her side, guiding her gently to the deck. The toothy mesh dug into her ungloved hand. She chided herself for forgetting her gloves.
“How many reds did you *take*?” Mica asked, handing Em some gauze.
“Two or three. Per hour.”
“God, how are you not in arrest?”
“I come from a long line of addicts.”
“Not funny, miss.”
“I’m fine.”
“Stay down until your system is clear.”
“Can’t order me. You’re . . . underclassman.”
“I got this.” Mica stood up and walked over to a crate and wheeled a plasma tank over. Em stood and followed.
“Is that the right hemotype—” Em took the catheter from the tank but suddenly forgot what she was about to do with it.
“Stop. Any more and I tell the old man. How many shifts in a row is this for you?” Mica took the catheter from her and turned the boy’s forearm anterior side up.
“Make sure it’s secure.”
“I know how to run a line, miss. Out.”

She left a bloody handprint on the tarp as she pushed her way out of the medbay. The sheets delimiting the operating rooms swayed gently while behind them the machinations of some grotesque puppet theater drew shadows. The streak from a surgeon’s headlamp dashed across a surface. A bonesaw spun up.
Casualties were still coming in this late after the crash. Fresh ones too, injuries consistent with high-speed impact and burns and a few cases of crush syndrome. Fisk hadn’t emerged from his seclusion yet. He was always sawing away at something. What did residents call him? The watchtower? No, watchmaker. He didn’t use scopes, only spectacles and his bare eyes. Blessed mother. You know you’re tanked when you’re forgetting your gossip.
